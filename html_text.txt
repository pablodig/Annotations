AbstractThe small GTPase Rab1b is essential for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi  transport, but its exact function remains unclear. We have examined the  effects of wild-type and three mutant forms of Rab1b in vivo. We show that the  inactive form of Rab1b (the N121I mutant with impaired guanine nucleotide  binding) blocks forward transport of cargo and induces Golgi disruption. The  phenotype is analogous to that induced by brefeldin A (BFA): it causes  resident Golgi proteins to relocate to the ER and induces redistribution of  ER-Golgi intermediate compartment proteins to punctate structures. The COPII  exit machinery seems to be functional in cells expressing the N121I mutant,  but COPI is compromised, as shown by the release of β-COP into the  cytosol. Our results suggest that Rab1b function influences COPI recruitment.  In support of this, we show that the disruptive effects of N121I can be  reversed by expressing known mediators of COPI recruitment, the GTPase ARF1  and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. Further evidence is provided  by the finding that cells expressing the active form of Rab1b (the Q67L mutant  with impaired GTPase activity) are resistant to BFA. Our data suggest a novel  role for Rab1b in ARF1- and GBF1-mediated COPI recruitment pathway.INTRODUCTIONThe secretory pathway in mammalian cells consists of a linear assembly of  dynamic compartments. Transport and recycling between these compartments occur  through generation of transport intermediates from the donor compartment and  the delivery of such intermediates to the appropriate acceptor compartment. A  family of Rab proteins belonging to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases has  emerged as essential regulators of all stages of membrane traffic  (Pfeffer, 2001;  Segev, 2001b;  Zerial and McBride, 2001).  Rabs have been proposed to act in diverse aspects of vesicular transport,  including vesicle formation, motility, docking, and fusion. However, despite  considerable advances, the exact mechanism of Rab function remains  unclear.In the early secretory pathway, two isoforms of Rab1, Rab1a and Rab1b, have  been shown to be required for protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum  (ER) to the cis-Golgi (Plutner  et al., 1991; Tisdale  et al., 1992; Nuoffer  et al., 1994; Pind  et al., 1994). A yeast homologue of Rab1, YPT1, is also  essential for ER-to-Golgi transport (Segev  et al., 1988). The cellular function of Rab1 is likely to  involve temporally and spatially distinct interactions with its effectors. Two  Rab1 effectors have been identified as the tethering factors p115 and GM130  (Allan et al., 2000;  Moyer et al., 2001; Weide et  al., 2001). Similarly, in yeast, YPT1 has been shown to  interact genetically with the yeast homologue of p115, USO1  (Sapperstein et al.,  1996).Rabs cycle continuously between a GDP- and a GTP-bound form  (Schimmoller et al.,  1998). The GTP-bound conformation is regarded as  “active” and can interact with downstream effector proteins  (Segev, 2001a;  Zerial and McBride, 2001).  Conversion of the GTP- to the GDP-bound form is caused by GTP hydrolysis,  facilitated by a GTPase-activating protein. After GTP hydrolysis and the  corresponding conformational shift, Rabs interact with a GDP dissociation  inhibitor (GDI) that can extract them from the membrane and support their  transient existence in the cytosol. The Rab-GDI complex is then specifically  recognized by a membrane Rab receptor (the identity of which is unknown) that  displaces the GDI and subsequently allows the Rab to bind a new GTP in a  reaction mediated by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Because the  continuous cycling of Rabs between these states is necessary for their  function, mutations that alter nucleotide loading, exchange, or hydrolysis can  be used to explore the cellular role of α Rab.To explore the function of Rab1b in vivo, we used a “dominant  negative” approach shown to be useful in elucidating the functions of  distinct Rabs and their effectors (Segev,  2001a; Zerial and McBride,  2001). We generated a Q67L mutant with low GTPase activity, an  S22N mutant with low affinity for GTP but normal affinity for GDP  (Nuoffer et al.,  1994), and an N121I mutant with low affinity for both GDP and GTP  (Pind et al., 1994).  Although some mutants of Rab1b or the equivalent mutants of Rab1a (Q65L, S25N,  N124I) have been partially characterized  (Tisdale et al.,  1992; Nuoffer et al.,  1994; Pind et al.,  1994), previous experiments examined limited number of parameters  and used different experimental systems. We used the same methodology to  examine the effects of all the Rab1b mutants on (1) ER-Golgi traffic, by  monitoring the transport of a cargo protein; (2) Golgi and ER-Golgi  intermediate compartment (ERGIC) structure, by analyzing the localization of  resident Golgi and ERGIC proteins; (3) the response of Rab1b effectors, by  analyzing the behavior of p115 and GM130; (4) the status of the COPII  machinery, by exploring the behavior of Sec13 and Sec31; and (5) the status of  the COPI machinery, by exploring the behavior of β-COP.Our data indicate that expression of the wild-type Rab1b and the  constitutively active Q67L mutant has limited effect on ER-Golgi trafficking  and Golgi structure. In contrast, the inactive S22N mutant causes partial  Golgi disruption, whereas the inactive N121I mutant completely disrupts Golgi  structure. The N121I mutant causes brefeldin A (BFA)-like phenotype and  induces the relocation of resident Golgi proteins to the ER and the  redistribution of ERGIC53, GM130, and p115 to punctate structures shown in  BFA-treated cells to represent ER exit sites and arrested vesicular tubular  clusters (VTCs) (Ward et al.,  2001). In addition, N121I causes the dissociation of β-COP  from membranes, implicating Rab1b in a pathway leading to COPI recruitment.  Supportive evidence for the role of Rab1b in COPI dynamics was provided by the  rescue of the N121I phenotype by expression of ARF1 and GBF1, known mediators  of COPI recruitment (Lippincott-Schwartz  et al., 1998;  Kawamoto et al.,  2002). Similarly, like expression of ARF1 or GBF1, expression of  the active Q67L mutant of Rab1b prevented Golgi fragmentation and β-COP  dissociation in BFA-treated cells. Together, our data suggest a role for Rab1b  in the GBF1/ARF1-mediated pathway for COPI recruitment. Future work will be  necessary to address how Rab1b modulates the COPI recruitment machinery.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodiesRabbit polyclonal antibodies against p115 and mouse polyclonal antibodies  against GM130 have been described (Barroso  et al., 1995; Nelson  et al., 1998). Monoclonal anti-giantin G1/133  (Linstedt and Hauri, 1993) and  monoclonal anti-ERGIC53 G1/93 (Schweizer  et al., 1988) antibodies were provided by Dr. Hans-Peter  Hauri (University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland). Polyclonal antibodies against  Mann II (Velasco et al.,  1993) were provided by Dr. Marilyn Farquhar (University of  California, San Diego, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab1b and anti-myc  antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).  Monoclonal anti-myc antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).  Monoclonal anti-VSV-G (P5D4) antibodies  (Roman et al., 1988)  were provided by Dr. Kathryn Howell (University of Colorado, Denver, CO). Goat  anti-rat and anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with Oregon Green or Texas Red-X  were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Antibodies against Sec13  and Sec31 (Tang et al.,  2000) were provided by Dr. Bor Luen Tang (National University of  Singapore, Republic of Singapore).Generation of ConstructsThe GalT-GFP construct was provided by Dr. Brian Storrie (Virginia Tech,  Blacksburg, VA) (Storrie et al.,  1998). ARF1 wild-type and ARF1Q71L were gifts from Dr. Julie  Donaldson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Full-length Rab1b was  cloned into the EcoRI-NotI restriction sites of the  pEF6/Myc-His B 6P vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Full-length  Rab1b was obtained by PCR using as a template a human cDNA library. The  primers used for rab1b were 5′-CCGGAATTCCCATGAACCCCGAATATGAC-3′  (forward primer) and 5′-TGCCCGCGGCCGCAACAGCCACCGCCAGCG-3′ (reverse  primer) to amplify full-length rab1b (sequence data available from Gen Bank  under accession number NM030981). Point mutations were introduced with a Quick  Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol  (Stratagene Corp., La Jolla, CA). All mutated Rab1 sequences were verified by  sequencing. GFP-rab1b versions were subcloned from their respective rab1-myc  constructs into pEGFP-vector. GBF1 was obtained from a partial human GBF1 cDNA  (KIAA0248) from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute in Chiba, Japan. The missing  fragment was amplified from a human lung cDNA library. The PCR product was  then subcloned into the KIAA0248 clone using the internal EcoRI site  at base 1124 and an engineered external XhoI site. To generate  GBFmyc, wtGBF1 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA4.0/TO/myc-his  (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).Morphological Analysis of VSV-G TransportAnalysis was performed as described previously  (Alvarez et al.,  1999). Briefly, HeLa cells plated on coverslips were transfected  with Rab1 constructs. After 24 h, cells were infected with VSVtsO45 at  32°C for 30 min, followed by incubation at 42°C for 3 h to accumulate  VSV-G in the ER. The cells were then shifted to 32°C for different amounts  of time to allow VSV-G transport to the Golgi and the plasma membrane.  Transport was terminated by transferring coverslips to ice and fixing them in  3% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min. The coverslips were then processed for  double-label immunofluorescence.Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence MicroscopyCells grown on glass coverslips were washed three times in PBS and fixed in  3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Paraformaldehyde  was quenched with 10 mM ammonium chloride, and cells were permeabilized with  PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 7 min at room temperature. The coverslips were  washed (three times, 2 min per wash) with PBS, then blocked in PBS, 0.4% fish  skin gelatin, 0.2% Tween 20 for 5 min, followed by blocking in PBS, 2.5% goat  serum, 0.2% Tween for 5 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibody  diluted in PBS, 0.4% fish skin gelatin, 0.2% Tween 20 for 45 min at 37°C.  Coverslips were washed (five times, 5 min per wash) with PBS, 0.2% Tween 20.  Secondary antibodies coupled to Oregon Green or Texas Red-X were diluted in  2.5% goat serum and incubated on coverslips for 30 min at 37°C. Coverslips  were washed with PBS, 0.2% Tween 20 as above and mounted on slides in 9:1  glycerol:PBS with 0.1% q-phenylenediamine. Fluorescence patterns were  visualized with an Olympus IX70 epifluorescence microscope. Optical sections  were captured with a CCD high-resolution camera equipped with a  camera/computer interface. Images were analyzed with a power Mac using IPLab  Spectrum software (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA).RESULTSGeneration and Expression of Mutant Forms of Rab1bTo generate reagents for our studies, a myc-his tag was added to the C  terminus of wild-type and three mutant forms of Rab1b (Q67L, S22N, and N121I).  Because Rab1b is prenylated on C-terminal cysteine residues  (Khosravi-Far et al.,  1991), and this modification is important for its membrane  association, we also generated wild-type and mutant forms tagged at the  N-terminus with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). As shown in  Figure 1, A and B, myc- or  GFP-tagged proteins of the appropriate molecular weight (∼27 and ∼55  kDa, respectively) were detected in lysates from transfected HeLa cells but  not in control lysates. Approximately the same amounts of wild-type Rab1b and  each mutant were detected 24 h after transfection, compared with the loading  baseline provided by calnexin.Figure 1. Expression and localization of wild-type and mutant Rab1b. HeLa cells were  transfected with myc- or GFP-tagged wild-type Rab1b, the Q67L mutant, the S22N  mutant, or the N121I mutant and analyzed 24 h later by Western blotting (A and  B) or immunofluorescence (C and D). Cell lysates were obtained and processed  by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-myc and anti-calnexin antibodies (A)  or with anti-GFP and anti-calnexin antibodies (B). Control lanes contain  lysates from untransfected cells. Levels of expression of all constructs are  similar. Cells were processed for immunofluorescence by use of anti-myc  antibodies (C) or GFP fluorescence (D). Wild-type Rab1b and the Q67L mutant  localize to the Golgi. The S22N mutant is detected in the cytosol and also in  a reticulate pattern. The N121I mutant shows diffuse cytosol staining.The myc- and GFP-tagged proteins show analogous localization  (Figure 1, C and D). The myc-  and GFP-tagged wild-type and Q67L mutants localize predominantly to  morphologically normal Golgi membranes. In contrast, the S22N mutants show  more diffuse patterns, most likely representing cytosolic and reticular ER  localization. The N121I mutants show diffuse cytosolic staining. Our results  with myc- and GFP-tagged Rab1b are identical to previously reported  localization of GFP-tagged Rab1a (Moyer  et al., 2001b).Effects of Mutant Forms of Rab1b on Cargo TransportPrevious studies have shown that the S22N and the N121I mutants of Rab1a  cause dominant negative effects on secretory traffic  (Tisdale et al.,  1992; Nuoffer et al.,  1994; Pind et al.,  1994). To functionally characterize our Rab1b mutants, we analyzed  the transport of a transmembrane glycoprotein (VSV-G) of the vesicular  stomatitis virus (VSV) in HeLa cells transfected with wild-type or mutant  Rab1b. The infection was performed at the nonpermissive temperature of  42°C to accumulate VSV-G in the ER  (Figure 2, 42°C, insets).  The cells were then shifted to the permissive temperature of 32°C for 40  min to allow VSV-G to be transported to the Golgi  (Figure 2, 32°C, 40 min  panels) or shifted to the permissive temperature of 32°C for 120 min to  allow VSV-G to be transported to the PM  (Figure 2, 32°C, 120 min  panels). The localization of VSV-G was monitored by immunofluorescence. VSV-G  is transported to the Golgi at 40 min and to the PM at 120 min in cells  expressing wild-type Rab1b or the Q67L mutant (transfected cells in this and  following figures are denoted with asterisks). These results are consistent  with previous biochemical findings on Rab1a showing that VSV-G becomes endo-H  resistant in cells transfected with the Q67L mutant  (Tisdale et al.,  1992). In cells expressing the S22N mutant, VSV-G is found in  perinuclear punctate structures and does not transit to the PM, even after 120  min at the permissive temperature. This is consistent with biochemical data on  Rab1a showing that expression of the S22N mutant in cells prevents endo-H  resistance of VSV-G (Tisdale et  al., 1992). In cells expressing the N121I mutant, VSV-G is  retained in the ER, consistent with biochemical data on Rab1a showing Endo-H  sensitivity of VSV-G in transfected cells  (Tisdale et al.,  1992; Pind et al.,  1994).Figure 2. Rab1b mutants block cargo transport. HeLa cells were transfected with  wild-type Rab1b, the Q67L mutant, the S22N mutant, or the N121I mutant. After  24 h, cells were infected with VSVtsO45 at 42°C. After 3 h, cells were  either fixed (insets), incubated at 32°C for 40 min (32°C-40 min  panels), or incubated at 32°C for 120 min (32°C-120 min panels) before  fixation. Cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence with anti-myc antibodies  to detect transfected cells (asterisks) and with anti-VSV-G antibodies. In  cells expressing wild-type Rab1b or the Q67L mutant, VSV-G is transported to  the Golgi at 40 min and to the cell surface at 120 min. In cells expressing  the S22N mutant, VSV-G is transported out of the ER into punctate structures  at 40 min and remains in such structures at 120 min. In cells expressing the  N121I mutant, VSV-G is retained in the ER at 40 min and at 120 min. Bars, 10  μm.Effects of Mutant Forms of Rab1b on Golgi StructureThe effects of expressing wild-type or mutant Rab1b in vivo have not been  reported previously. As shown in Figure  3, cells expressing the wild-type or the Q67L mutant have normal  Golgi, as visualized by the localization of two resident Golgi proteins  (mannosidase II and giantin), and normal ERGIC, as visualized by the  distribution of ERGIC53. In contrast, transient expression of the S22N mutant  leads to partial Golgi disruption and relocation of mannosidase II and giantin  into perinuclear elements. Such elements seem to be concentrated in the Golgi  region, but some more peripheral structures are also detected. The ERGIC53  pattern also shows partial redistribution to more peripheral elements. The  Golgi is completely disrupted in cells expressing the N121I mutant, with  mannosidase II and giantin disappearing from the Golgi and redistributing to  the ER. The disruption seems to be progressive, and in some cells (arrowhead),  punctate perinuclear structures containing giantin can be seen. An adjacent  cell, presumably expressing higher levels of the mutant or for a longer  period, has a completely diffuse giantin pattern. The distribution of ER-GIC53  seems to be less disturbed, although relocation of the protein from a  peri-Golgi region to peripheral structures is observed. Quantitative analysis  shows that the vast majority of cells expressing the S22N mutant (88% of  transfected cells) or the N121I mutant (85% of transfected cells) present the  described phenotypes. The disruption was observed even at moderate and low  levels of expression, attesting to the strong dominant effects of these Rab1b  mutants in cells.Figure 3. Rab1b mutants induce Golgi disruption. HeLa cells were transfected with the  wild-type Rab1b, the Q67L mutant, the S22N mutant, or the N121I mutant. Cell  were analyzed 24 h later by immunofluorescence with anti-myc antibodies to  detect transfected cells (asterisks) and with anti-mannosidase II  (anti-MannII), antigiantin, or anti-ERGIC53 antibodies (see respective  panels). Wild-type Rab1b and the Q67L mutant do not affect the structure of  the Golgi or ERGIC. The S22N mutant partially disrupts Golgi and induces the  formation of punctate structures in the Golgi region. The N121I mutant causes  complete Golgi disruption, with MannII and giantin redistributing to the ER  and ERGIC53 relocating to peripheral punctate structures. The distribution of  Golgi and ERGIC markers in cells expressing the N121I mutant is similar to  that induced by a 30-min BFA (5 μg/ml) treatment (BFA panels). Bars, 10  μm.The effects of the N121I mutant resembled those caused by BFA treatment,  and representative images of cells treated with BFA are shown in  Figure 3, BFA panels. BFA  treatment causes Golgi disassembly and the relocation of resident Golgi  proteins to the ER. BFA also induces relocation of ERGIC53 to punctate  structures, shown by others to represent ER exit sites and immature VTCs  (Ward et al.,  2001).We also explored the localization of two Rab1 effectors, GM130 and p115, in  cells expressing wild-type and mutant Rab1b. As shown in  Figure 4, the localization of  GM130 and p115 is not influenced by the expression of either the wild-type  Rab1b or the Q67L mutant. In cells expressing the S22N mutant, GM130 and to a  greater extent p115 are redistributed from the Golgi to punctate peripheral  structures. In cells expressing the N121I mutant, GM130 and p115 localization  is disrupted, and both are found in small punctate structures dispersed  throughout the cell. The observed patterns are analogous to those induced by  BFA treatment (Figure 4, BFA  panels). BFA inhibits the activity of guanine nucleotide exchange factors  (GEFs) for ARFs and prevents COPI recruitment  (Donaldson et al.,  1992; Helms and Rothman,  1992). Because expression of the N121I mutant causes BFA-like  phenotype, we explored whether Rab1b could be involved in COPI  recruitment.Figure 4. Rab1b mutants induce redistribution of its effectors GM130 and p115. HeLa  cells were transfected with wild-type Rab1b, the Q67L mutant, the S22N mutant,  or the N121I mutant and analyzed 24 h later by immunofluorescence with  anti-myc antibodies to detect transfected cells (asterisks) and with either  anti-GM130 or anti-p115 antibodies (see respective panels). In cells  expressing wild-type Rab1b or the Q67L mutant, GM130 localizes to the Golgi,  whereas p115 is found in the Golgi and in peripheral punctate structures. In  cells expressing the S22N mutant, GM130 and p115 are partially localized to  the Golgi but also show redistribution to peripheral punctate structures. In  cells expressing the N121I mutant, both GM130 and p115 are completely  redistributed to peripheral punctate structures. The redistribution of GM130  and p115 is similar to that induced by a 30-min BFA (5 μg/ml) treatment  (BFA panels). Bars, 10 μm.A Mutant Form of Rab1b Perturbs COPI Coat AssemblyWe first examined the effects of Rab1b mutants on the assembly of COPII  coats, because these have been reported to be unaffected by BFA treatment  (Ward et al., 2001).  As shown in Figure 5, the  localization of the Sec13 and the Sec31components of the COPII coat seems to  be normal in cells expressing the wild-type or the Q67L mutant. Sec13 and  Sec31 are present in punctate structures concentrated in the Golgi region and  also in more peripheral sites. In cells expressing the S22N or the N121I  mutant, the overall Sec13 and Sec31 pattern still appears normal, but with  fewer peri-Golgi structures. Distribution of ER exit sites has been shown to  be influenced by the Golgi (Ward et  al., 2001). Significantly, even in cells expressing the N121I  mutant, both Sec13 and Sec31 are efficiently recruited to ER exit sites.Figure 5. Rab1b mutants do not perturb COPII recruitment. HeLa cells were transfected  with wild-type Rab1b, the Q67L mutant, the S22N mutant, or the N121I mutant  and analyzed 24 h later by immunofluorescence with anti-myc antibodies to  detect transfected cells (asterisks) and with either anti-Sec13 or anti-Sec31  antibodies (see respective panels). In cells expressing wild-type Rab1b or the  Q67L mutant, COPII markers distribute in normal patterns. In cells expressing  the S22N mutant or the N121I mutant, COPII markers present a relatively normal  pattern but with fewer punctate structures in the Golgi region. Bars, 10  μm.The results indicate that cells expressing the N121I mutant recruit COPII  and ERGIC53 to ER exit sites and immature VTCs but are unable to sort and  deliver resident Golgi proteins into those structures (compare Figures  5 and  3). To ensure that this is not  because of different N121I expression levels in distinct cells, we compared  the localization of Sec31 and ERGIC53 to the localization of a resident Golgi  protein (galactosyl transferase, Gal-T) in the same cell. Cells were  cotransfected with the N121I mutant and GFP-tagged Gal-T, and the localization  of Sec31 or ERGIC53 was compared with the localization of GalT-GFP. As shown  in Figure 6, in  N121I-transfected cells (see insets), GalT-GFP is detected in a diffuse ER  pattern. Gal-T-GFP is not recruited into ER exit sites or immature VTCs, even  though Sec31 and ERGIC53 are efficiently sorted and maintained in those  structures.Figure 6. The N121I mutant prevents sorting of a Golgi enzyme. HeLa cells were  cotransfected with the N121I mutant and GFP-tagged Gal-T and analyzed 24 h  later by immunofluorescence with anti-myc antibodies to detect transfected  cells (insets) and with either anti-Sec31 or anti-ERGIC53 antibodies. Gal-T  was detected by green fluorescence. Gal-T is localized to the ER in the same  cells in which Sec31 or ERGIC53 present punctate patterns. Bars, 10 μm.We next explored the distribution of the β-COP component of COPI in  cells expressing wild-type or mutant Rab1b. As shown in  Figure 7, β-COP panels, in  cells expressing the wild-type or the Q67L mutant, β-COP distributes to  the Golgi and to peripheral sites. The pattern is indistinguishable from that  in untransfected cells. In cells expressing the S22N mutant, the β-COP  pattern is more dispersed and parallels the redistribution observed for  ERGIC53. A more dramatic effect is seen in cells expressing the N121I mutant,  with the majority of β-COP being in a diffuse cytosolic pattern. The  N121I-induced β-COP dissociation is analogous to that seen in BFA-treated  cells (Figure 7, BFA  panel).Figure 7. The N121I mutant induces β-COP dissociation and relocation of GBF1.  HeLa cells were transfected with wild-type Rab1b, the Q67L mutant, the S22N  mutant, or the N121I mutant (see respective panels) and analyzed 24 h later by  immunofluorescence with anti-myc antibodies to detect transfected cells  (asterisks) and with either anti-β-COP or anti-GBF1 antibodies. In cells  expressing wild-type Rab1b or the Q67L mutant, β-COP and GBF1 distribute  in normal patterns. In cells expressing the S22N mutant, β-COP and GBF1  present a more punctate peri-Golgi pattern. In cells expressing the N121I  mutant, β-COP and GBF1 are not associated with a distinguishable  compartment and appear diffuse. GBF1 is detected in the nuclear membrane  (arrowhead), indicating ER localization. The redistribution of β-COP and  GBF1 is similar to that induced by a 30-min BFA (5 μg/ml) treatment (BFA  panels). Bars, 10 μm.Because β-COP recruitment requires membrane-associated ARF, and GBF1  has been shown to recruit ARFs to membranes  (Kawamoto et al.,  2002), we examined the distribution of GBF1 in cells expressing  the wild-type Rab1b and the various mutants. As shown in  Figure 7, GBF1 panels, in cells  expressing the wild-type or the Q67L mutant (transfected cells denoted by  asterisks), GBF1 distributes to the Golgi and to peripheral sites. The pattern  is indistinguishable from those in neighboring untransfected cells. In cells  expressing the S22N mutant, GBF1 localization is altered, with GBF1 relocating  to punctate structures concentrated in the Golgi region. A dramatic  redistribution of GBF1 is seen in cells expressing the N121I mutant. Although  the distribution of GBF1 appears diffuse, the nuclear membrane is labeled  (arrowhead), indicative of ER localization. The N121I-induced GBF1 pattern is  analogous to that seen in BFA-treated cells  (Figure 7, BFA panel), in which  GBF1 relocates to the ER.Expression of ARF1 or GBF1 Rescues β-COP Dissociation Induced by  a Mutant Form of Rab1bGolgi disruption and β-COP dissociation induced by the N121I mutant  are analogous to those induced by BFA. BFA inhibits the activity of a GEF for  ARFs and prevents ARF activation (Donaldson  et al., 1992; Helms  and Rothman, 1992). To determine whether Rab1b-catalyzed events  might participate in COPI recruitment, we explored the possibility that the  N121I mutant causes its effects through an inhibitory effect on the  ARF1-mediated COPI recruitment pathway. If that were the case, than  overexpression of ARF1 should rescue the N121I-induced β-COP  dissociation. To test this, we cotransfected the N121I mutant with wild-type  ARF1. Expression of ARF1 has no detectable effect on Golgi structure or  β-COP localization (our unpublished results)  (Teal et al., 1994).  As shown in Figure 8A, a cell  cotransfected with N121I and ARF1 (arrowhead) shows β-COP in a  membrane-associated Golgi-like pattern. In contrast, a cell transfected only  with the N121I mutant (asterisk) shows diffuse distribution of β-COP.Figure 8. Expression of ARF1 or GBF1 rescues β-COP disassembly induced by the  N121I mutant. HeLa cells were cotransfected with GFP-tagged N121I mutant and  HA-tagged wild-type ARF1 (A) or with GFP-tagged N121I mutant and myc-tagged  GBF1 (B). After 24 h, cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence with  anti-β-COP antibodies and with either anti-HA or anti-myc antibodies.  GFP-N121I was detected by green fluorescence. In cotransfected cells  (arrowheads), β-COP is membrane associated. In cells transfected only  with N121I (asterisks), β-COP is cytosolic. In C, cells were transfected  only with myc-tagged GBF1. Overexpression of GBF1 causes partial Golgi  fragmentation. Bars, 10 μm.The Sec7-family member GBF1 is an exchange factor for ARF1 in vivo  (Kawamoto et al.,  2002). Because expression of ARF1 rescues the N121I phenotype, we  explored whether GBF1 could also reverse the N121I effect. We cotransfected  cells with the N121I mutant and wild-type GBF1. As shown in  Figure 8B, in cells  cotransfected with the N121I mutant and GBF1 (arrowheads), β-COP is  retained on membranes. β-COP is associated with the Golgi and with  punctate peri-Golgi structures. This pattern is analogous to that in cells  expressing only GBF1 (Figure  8C). The peri-Golgi structures are most likely caused by a  GBF1-mediated increase in COPI recruitment to membranes. In cells expressing  only the N121I mutant (asterisk), β-COP is diffusely distributed in the  cytosol. It seems that both ARF1 and GBF1 can antagonize the effect of the  N121I mutant and maintain β-COP association with membranes.Expression of the Active Mutant of Rab1b Confers BFA Resistance to  CellsPrevious studies have documented that expression of proteins known to be  involved in COPI recruitment, such as the active form of ARF1 and GBF1,  confers BFA resistance to transfected cells  (Teal et al., 1994;  Claude et al., 1999;  Kawamoto et al.,  2002; Zhao et al.,  2002). In agreement, we show that the expression of the active  Q71L mutant of ARF1 prevents Golgi redistribution in BFA-treated cells  (Figure 9A). As shown in that  figure, a cell transfected with ARF1-Q71L shows normal Golgi localization of  p115 (arrowhead). An adjacent untransfected cell shows the typical BFA-induced  p115 pattern (compare to p115 localization in  Figure 4, BFA panel).  Similarly, expression of GBF1 confers BFA resistance  (Figure 9A), in agreement with  previous reports (Claude et al.,  1999; Kawamoto et  al., 2002; Zhao et  al., 2002). Cells expressing GBF1 show Golgi localization of  p115 (arrowheads), whereas an untransfected cell shows a dispersed p115  pattern. Quantification of the BFA resistance of transfected cells (defined as  Golgi pattern of p115) shows that ∼4% of cells transfected with a control  plasmid encoding GFP are BFA resistant, whereas ∼41% of cells transfected  with the ARF1-Q71L plasmid and ∼39% of cells transfected with the GBF1  plasmid are BFA resistant (Figure  9B).Figure 9. Rab1-Q67L-transfected cells are BFA resistant. HeLa cells were transfected  with HA-tagged ARF1-Q71L myc-tagged GBF1, or GFP-tagged Rab1b-Q67L. After 24  h, cells were treated with BFA (30 min; 5 μg/ml) and analyzed by  immunofluorescence with either anti-HA or anti-myc antibodies to detect  transfected cells and with anti-p115, anti-GBF1, or anti-β-COP antibodies  to detect the Golgi. GFP-Rab1b-Q67L was detected by green fluorescence. Cells  transfected with either ARF1-Q71L or GBF1 are BFA resistant, as shown by a  Golgi pattern of p115 (arrowheads in A). The percentage of cells transfected  with a control plasmid (encoding GFP), ARF1Q71L, GBF1, or Rab1-Q67L that are  BFA resistant was quantified and is plotted as a bar graph (B). Bars represent  the average of two independent experiments using p115 as a Golgi marker (50  transfected cells were counted in each experiment). Cells transfected with  Rab1b-Q67L are BFA resistant, as shown by Golgi pattern of p115 and GBF1 and  partial membrane association of β-COP (arrowheads in C). Bars, 10  μm.To test whether expression of the active form of Rab1b also confers BFA  resistance, we transfected cells with the Q67L mutant and then treated them  with BFA. As shown in Figure  9C, cells expressing the Q67L mutant are BFA resistant, as shown  by Golgi localization of the Q67L protein and of p115 (arrowhead). Two  adjacent untransfected cells show typical BFA-induced p115 pattern.  Quantification of the BFA resistance of transfected cells (defined as Golgi  pattern of p115) indicates that ∼35% of cells transfected with the Q67L  mutant are resistant to BFA (Figure  9B). Expression of the Q67L mutant also prevents GBF1 relocation  to the ER in BFA-treated cells (Figure  9C). A cell expressing the Q67L mutant shows Golgi localization of  GBF1 (arrowhead), whereas an adjacent untransfected cell shows redistribution  of GBF1 to the ER. Quantification of the BFA resistance of transfected cells  (defined as Golgi pattern of GBF1) indicates that ∼35% of cells  transfected with the Q67L mutant are resistant to BFA (our unpublished  results). The level of BFA resistance conferred by the Rab1b-Q67L mutant is  analogous to that conferred by ARF1-Q71L (∼41%) or by GBF1 (∼39%).  Expression of wild-type Rab1 also prevents p115 relocation in BFA-treated  cells; quantification of the BFA resistance of transfected cells (defined as  Golgi pattern of p115) indicates that ∼30% of cells transfected with  wild-type Rab1 are resistant to BFA (our unpublished results).Expression of the Q67L mutant partially antagonizes BFA-induced release of  β-COP, and a cell expressing the Q67L mutant shows membrane-associated  β-COP in a Golgi region (arrowhead), in addition to a more diffuse  cellular staining (Figure 9C).  Adjacent untransfected cells show exclusively diffuse localization of  β-COP. Quantification of the persistence of membrane-associated  β-COP in transfected cells (defined as Golgi pattern of β-COP)  indicates that ∼15% of cells transfected with either the Q67L mutant or  GBF1 show BFA-resistant β-COP localization (our unpublished results).DISCUSSIONHere, we provide a comprehensive analysis of Rab1b function in cells by  examining the effects of mutant forms of Rab1b on (1) ER-Golgi traffic, (2)  Golgi and ERGIC structure, (3) the response of Rab1b effectors, (4) the status  of the COPII machinery, and (5) the status of the COPI machinery. In our  studies, we use Rab1b constructs tagged at the C terminus with myc or at the  N-terminus with GFP. Rabs are posttranslationally prenylated (by addition of a  20-carbon geranylgeranyl to the C-terminal GGCC motif)  (Farnsworth et al.,  1994), and prenylation has been shown to be required for membrane  association of the yeast homologue of rab1a, YPT1  (Newman et al.,  1992). We did not formally analyze whether our C-terminally  myc-tagged constructs are prenylated. However, because the myc-tagged  wild-type Rab1b associates efficiently with membranes, we assume that the myc  tag does not prevent prenylation. It has been shown that Rabs containing the  -CCXXX motif are prenylated (Pereira-Leal  and Seabra, 2000), suggesting that addition of C-terminal amino  acids might not prevent prenylation. Furthermore, we show that the myc-tagged  constructs behave identically to constructs tagged at the N-terminus with GFP  and induce the same phenotypes.Effects of Rab1b MutantsQ67L The Q67L mutant localizes to peripheral VTCs and to  the Golgi in a pattern indistinguishable from that of a wild-type protein.  Expression of the Q67L mutant has no detectable effect on any of the tested  parameters, in agreement with previously published data  (Tisdale et al.,  1992). Although the Q67L mutant is expected to have reduced  intrinsic GTPase activity in vitro, it is likely to interact with a GAP that  would promote GTP hydrolysis to normal levels in vivo. The lack of visible  enlargement of VTCs or the Golgi in transfected cells differs from the effects  observed in the endosomal system, in which the expression of GTP-restricted  Rab5 increases the rate of internalization and leads to the formation of  enlarged endosomes (Barbieri et  al., 1996; Seachrist  et al., 2001).S22N The S22N mutant presents a diffuse cellular staining  without a clear compartmental staining. In some cells, a faint nuclear and  reticular pattern can be discerned, suggesting that S22N might associate with  the ER. The partially cytosolic localization of this mutant is consistent with  its preferred GDP status and GDI-mediated extraction from membranes  (Alexandrov et al.,  1994). Expression of the S22N mutant leads to inhibition in  transport and the arrest of cargo VSV-G in fragmented perinuclear Golgi  structures. This is consistent with biochemical data showing that cargo VSV-G  remains endo-H sensitive in cells expressing the analogous Rab1a mutant  (Tisdale et al.,  1992). Cells transfected with S22N show Golgi disruption and  relocation of Golgi proteins to perinuclear fragments. It is likely that those  are analogous to Golgi elements induced in cells by microinjection of the S25N  Rab1a mutant and shown by electron microscopic analysis to resemble polarized  Golgi ministacks formed in the presence of nocodazole  (Wilson et al.,  1994). The COPII and COPI machinery is not noticeably perturbed in  transfected cells. It is likely that the S22N mutant mediates its effect by  competing with the endogenous Rab1b for binding to cellular accessory proteins  (possibly GDI or GEF) but does not act as an irreversible inhibitor, because  its effects can be rescued by overexpression of the wild-type protein  (Nuoffer et al.,  1994).N121I The N121I mutant localizes in a diffuse cellular  pattern without associating with a clearly defined compartment. Expression of  N121I in cells blocks the exit of cargo VSV-G from the ER and causes the  complete disassembly of the Golgi as monitored by the disappearance of  mannosidase II, giantin, GOS28 (not shown), and gal-T from the Golgi region  and their redistribution to the ER. This result is completely reproducible  when using either myc-tagged or GFP-tagged N121I mutant, and the  redistribution of four different proteins argues against a protein-specific  phenotype. The collapse of the Golgi is most easily explained by a block in  the anterograde pathway and continuing retrograde recycling, in agreement with  the established role of Rab1 in the forward traffic  (Plutner et al.,  1991; Tisdale et al.,  1992). Our findings differ from published data that show arrest in  VSV-G transport at the level of VTCs in cells expressing the N121I mutant  (Tisdale et al.,  1992) or in semi-intact cells supplemented with N121I  (Pind et al., 1994),  and the relocation of Golgi proteins into perinuclear structures in cells  microinjected with the N121I mutant  (Wilson et al.,  1994). The rationale for the differences in reported results and  our data is currently unclear. However, we provide further experimental  support for the disruptive effects of N121I by showing that it causes  dissociation of β-COP from membranes. The phenotype we describe is  analogous to that observed in cells treated with BFA  (Klausner et al.,  1992) or expressing the inactive mutant of ARF1  (Dascher and Balch, 1994). In  each case, β-COP is not associated with membranes, there is no sorting of  cargo and Golgi proteins into VTCs, and ER-Golgi traffic is inhibited.  Recruitment of COPI is required for the maturation of COPII-differentiated ER  exit sites into transport-competent VTCs, and this process seems to be  inhibited by N121I. The significantly more severe phenotype induced by N121I  versus S22N can be explained by the finding that N121I is expected to act as  an irreversible inhibitor in vivo, because its effects cannot be suppressed by  overexpression of wild-type Rab1b (Pind  et al., 1994).Rab1b and Its EffectorsGM130 has been identified as a Rab1a and Rab1b effector  (Moyer et al., 2001a)  (Weide et al., 2001),  whereas p115 has been identified as a Rab1a effector  (Allan et al., 2000).  Rab1a shares 92% identity with Rab1b  (Touchot et al.,  1987), and we detected p115 interaction with the active Q67L  mutant of Rab1b in a yeast dihybrid system (our unpublished results).  Surprisingly, expression of Q67L had a limited effect on GM130 and p115  distribution, but expression of S22N, and to an even larger extent, expression  of N121I, significantly influenced GM130 and p115 localization. The S22N  mutant caused partial relocation of both proteins from the Golgi to peripheral  punctate structures, whereas the N121I mutant caused complete redistribution  into a BFA-like punctate pattern. Significantly, both proteins remained  membrane associated. It has been suggested that the active form of Rab1 is  required for the recruitment of p115 to membranes in an in vitro COPII budding  assay (Allan et al.,  2000), but our in vivo results indicate that p115 can associate  with membranes independently of Rab1 activity. Similarly, the Rab3 effector  rabphilin3A also associates with membranes in a manner independent of active  Rab3 (Shirataki et al.,  1994). Although it seems that p115 recruitment to membranes is  mediated by other protein(s), subsequent p115 sorting or function might be  regulated by the active Rab1.Rab1b and COPI RecruitmentThe ability of the N121I mutant to induce β-COP dissociation from  membranes suggests that Rab1b participates in events leading to COPI  recruitment. A link between Rabs and COPI is not unexpected, because the  active form of Rab2 promotes β-COP recruitment to membranes  (Tisdale and Jackson, 1998),  and a relationship between Rabs and ARFs has been shown genetically in yeast  (Segev, 2001b). The Rab1b  yeast homologue YPT1 has been shown to interact genetically with GEA2, a  guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ARF1/2  (Jones et al., 1999).  Furthermore, there is synthetic lethality between YPT1 and ARF1, suggesting a  functional link between these GTPase families. In agreement, we document a  functional relationship between Rab1b and ARF1 by showing that (1) β-COP  dissociation induced by N121I can be reversed by overexpression of ARF1; (2)  overexpression of GBF1, a mammalian exchange factor for ARF, is also able to  reverse β-COP dissociation induced by N121I; and (3) overexpression of  the active Q67L mutant reverses β-COP dissociation induced by BFA. The  combined data suggest that the Rab and ARF families of GTPases interact in a  regulatory cascade mediating COPI recruitment.A plausible model for Rab1b function is that it might act to recruit or  activate GBF1, which in turn activates ARF, which then recruits COPI and  allows COPII/COPI exchange on VTCs. This model fits with the BFA-like  phenotype induced by N121I, because BFA has been shown to inhibit GEF  activity, thus preventing ARF activation and COPI recruitment. The model is  also consistent with our findings that Rab1b acts in the COPI pathway upstream  of ARF1 and GBF1 and that the block induced by N121I precedes formation of  VTCs. Previous work has shown that COPII/COPI exchange is necessary for  formation of VTCs (Pepperkok et  al., 1993; Peter et  al., 1993) and that the process seems to involve at least two  stages. The initial differentiation of the ER membrane into ER exit sites  occurs through the action of the COPII machinery, and the subsequent  maturation to VTCs requires recruitment of the COPI coat. In the absence of  active Rab1b, ER exit sites form, as shown by the localization of COPII  components and the sorting of ERGIC53, GM130, and p115, but such structures do  not differentiate into VTCs, as shown by the retention of cargo and Golgi  proteins in the ER. That Rab1b might participate in exit from the ER is also  strongly suggested by studies in Drosophila expressing the N124I  mutant under heat-shock promotor, in which expression of the mutant protein  caused extensive ER swelling in addition to the disruption of the Golgi and  block in ER-to-Golgi transport of rhodopsin  (Satoh et al., 1997).  Interestingly, expression of N124I also caused the accumulation of clusters of  small vesicles (<150 nm) close to the ER, perhaps indicating that COPI  function is required for their differentiation into VTCs.Our results significantly extend previous studies examining the effects of  mutant rab1b on Golgi structure and ER-Golgi transport in vivo and in vitro  and provide support for a novel function of rab1b in COPI coat assembly.  Future studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism of rab1b  function, to identify all its compartment-specific effectors, and to define  all the compartments and traffic steps at which it acts.FOOTNOTESArticle published online ahead of print.
