      "Assembly of the cytosolic coat protein I (COPI) complex at the ER–Golgi interface is directed by the ADP ribosylation factor1 (Arf1) and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GBF1). Rab1b GTPase modulates COPI recruitment, but the molecular mechanism underlying this action remains unclear. Our data reveal that in vivo expression of the GTP-restricted Rab1b mutant (Rab1Q67L) increased the association of GBF1 and COPI to peripheral structures localized at the ER exit sites (ERES) interface. Active Rab1b also stabilized Arf1 on Golgi membranes. Furthermore, we characterized GBF1 as a new Rab1b effector, and showed that its N-terminal domain was involved in this interaction. Rab1b small interfering RNA oligonucleotide assays suggested that Rab1b was required for GBF1 membrane association. To further understand how Rab1b functions in ER-to-Golgi transport, we analyzed GFP-Rab1b dynamics in HeLa cells. Time-lapse microscopy indicated that the majority of the Rab1b-labeled punctuated structures are relatively short-lived with limited-range movements. FRAP of Golgi GFP-Rab1bwt showed rapid recovery (t\n",

These data, together with the Rab1b dynamics presented here, allow us to propose a model where Rab1b is loaded independently at the ERES interface and Golgi complex, via direct exchange with the cytosolic pool, where it then interacts with GBF1 to enable the Arf1 activation required for COPI vesicle formation.\n",

Therefore, we consider it important to analyze Rab1b dynamics in order to understand how Rab1b functions in ER-to-Golgi transport. Time-lapse experiments were performed, and the movement of GFP-Rab1bwt–labeled peripheral structures was analyzed (Supplementary Video 1). Three different dynamic patterns (Supplementary Table S1) were defined to describe the behavior of Rab1b-labeled structures: Immobile (\n",

We think that the first option is more likely, because there was a small number of Rab1b-labeled structures (6%) that described a measurable trajectory. To corroborate this, the dynamics of the GFP-Rab1bwt-labeled structures were compared with dynamics of other peripheral structure markers. We performed time-lapse imaging with the bona fide VTCs/ERGIC marker p58-YFP (rat homolog of the human ERGIC53; Supplementary Video 3) and the COPII marker, Sec13-YFP (Supplementary Video 2).

Once in the membranes, active Rab1b interacts with a broad category of proteins to orchestrate every step (vesicle formation, tethering, and fusion) required for ER-to-Golgi and intra-Golgi transport. This model postulates that Rab1b is a key molecule required for synchronizing every early secretory transport event. Further analysis should focus on characterizing, in mammalian cells, how Rab1b recruitment and activation are achieved.\n",
