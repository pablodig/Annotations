0,Effective Chabauty for symmetric powers of curves,https://core.ac.uk/works/24811095,"Faltings' theorem states that curves of genus g≥2g \geq 2g≥2 have finitely many
rational points. Using the ideas of Faltings, Mumford, Parshin and Raynaud, one
obtains an upper bound on the number of rational points, but this bound is too
large to be used in any reasonable sense. In 1985, Coleman showed that
Chabauty's method, which works when the Mordell-Weil rank of the Jacobian of
the curve is smaller than ggg, can be used to give a good effective bound on
the number of rational points of curves of genus g>1g > 1g>1. We draw ideas from
nonarchimedean geometry to show that we can also give an effective bound on the
number of rational points outside of the special set of ddd-th symmetric power
of XXX, where XXX is a curve of genus g>dg > dg>d, when the Mordell-Weil rank of
the Jacobian of the curve is at most g−dg-dg−d and the curve further satisfies
certain rigid analytic conditions"
1,Lifting divisors with imposed ramifications on a generic chain of loops,https://core.ac.uk/works/44616528,"Proves that if a curve has totally split reduction and the corresponding
skeleton (as a metric graph) is a chain of loops with generic edge lengths,
then every divisor on the graph with imposed ramification at the rightmost
vertex ppp of the skeleton lifts to a divisor class on the curve with the same
ramification at some point PPP that retracts to ppp, extending the work of
Cartwright-Jensen-Payne. Gives a positive answer to lifting proper tropical
intersections within a polytopal domain in an analytic torus"
2,Functional Characterization of Rare RAB12 Variants and Their Role in Musician's and Other Dystonias,https://core.ac.uk/works/44981803,"Mutations in RAB (member of the Ras superfamily) genes are increasingly recognized as cause of a variety of disorders including neurological conditions. While musician's dystonia (MD) and writer's dystonia (WD) are task-specific movement disorders, other dystonias persistently affect postures as in cervical dystonia. Little is known about the underlying etiology. Next-generation sequencing revealed a rare missense variant (c.586A>
            G; p.Ile196Val) in RAB12 in two of three MD/WD families. Next, we tested 916 additional dystonia patients; 512 Parkinson's disease patients; and 461 healthy controls for RAB12 variants and identified 10 additional carriers of rare missense changes among dystonia patients (1.1%) but only one carrier in non-dystonic individuals (0.1%; p = 0.005). The detected variants among index patients comprised p.Ile196Val (n = 6); p.Ala174Thr (n = 3); p.Gly13Asp; p.Ala148Thr; and p.Arg181Gln in patients with MD; cervical dystonia; or WD. Two relatives of MD patients with WD also carried p.Ile196Val. The two variants identified in MD patients (p.Ile196Val; p.Gly13Asp) were characterized on endogenous levels in patient-derived fibroblasts and in two RAB12-overexpressing cell models. The ability to hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP), so called GTPase activity, was increased in mutants compared to wildtype. Furthermore, subcellular distribution of RAB12 in mutants was altered in fibroblasts. Soluble Transferrin receptor 1 levels were reduced in the blood of all three tested p.Ile196Val carriers. In conclusion, we demonstrate an enrichment of missense changes among dystonia patients. Functional characterization revealed altered enzyme activity and lysosomal distribution in mutants suggesting a contribution of RAB12 variants to MD and other dystonias"

49 provide a reliable estimate. Application of strict a posteriori criteria
make us confident about the quality of the 12 new mean-flow determinations,
which are the first reliable data available for the Kerguelen Archipelago. The
Virtual Dipole Moments (VDM) calculated for these flows vary from 2.78 to 9.47
10e22 Am2 with an arithmetic mean value of 6.15+-2.1 10e22 Am2. Compilation of
these results with a selection of the 2002 updated IAGA palaeointensity

previously reported, identical to the 5.5+-2.4 10e22 Am2 mean VDM obtained for
the 0.3-5 Ma time window. However, these Kerguelen palaeointensity estimates

  Theories",https://core.ac.uk/works/45957340,"Translating expressions between different logics and theorem provers is
notoriously and often prohibitively difficult, due to the large differences
between the logical foundations, the implementations of the systems, and the
structure of the respective libraries. Practical solutions for exchanging
theorems across theorem provers have remained both weak and brittle.
Consequently, libraries are not easily reusable across systems, and substantial
effort must be spent on reformalizing and proving basic results in each system.
Notably, this problem exists already if we only try to exchange theorem
statements and forgo exchanging proofs.
  In previous work we introduced alignments as a lightweight standard for
relating concepts across libraries and conjectured that it would provide a good
base for translating expressions. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility
of this approach. We use a foundationally uncommitted framework to write
interface theories that abstract from logical foundation, implementation, and
library structure. Then we use alignments to record how the concepts in the
interface theories are realized in several major proof assistant libraries, and
we use that information to translate expressions across libraries. Concretely,
we present exemplary interface theories for several areas of mathematics and -
in total - several hundred alignments that were found manually.Comment: In Proceedings PxTP 2017, arXiv:1712.0089"

use following abstinence. However, the molecular and neurobiological substrates that are engaged during early traumatic

events and mediate the greater risk of relapse are poorly understood and knowledge of risk factors is to date extremely

limited. In this study, we modeled childhood maltreatment by exposing juvenile mice to a threatening social

experience (social stressed, S-S). We showed that S-S experience influenced the propensity to reinstate cocaineseeking

after periods of withdrawal in adulthood. By exploring global gene expression in blood leukocytes we found that

this behavioral phenotype was associated with greater blood coagulation. In parallel, impairments in brain

microvasculature were observed in S-S mice. Furthermore, treatment with an anticoagulant agent during withdrawal

abolished the susceptibility to reinstate cocaine-seeking in S-S mice. These findings provide novel insights into a

possible molecular mechanism by which childhood maltreatment heightens the risk for relapse in cocaine-dependent

predicates, and that the Crane Beach Conjecture holds for MSO with monadic
predicates. The third is to show that it is decidable whether a language

9,A high throughput experimental approach to identify miRNA targets in human cells,https://core.ac.uk/works/3751597,"The study of human microRNAs is seriously hampered by the lack of proper tools allowing genome-wide identification of miRNA targets. We performed Ribonucleoprotein ImmunoPrecipitation—gene Chip (RIP-Chip) using antibodies against wild-type human Ago2 in untreated Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cell lines. Ten to thirty percent of the gene transcripts from the genome were enriched in the Ago2-IP fraction of untreated cells, representing the HL miRNA-targetome. In silico analysis indicated that ∼40% of these gene transcripts represent targets of the abundantly co-expressed miRNAs. To identify targets of miR-17/20/93/106, RIP-Chip with anti-miR-17/20/93/106 treated cells was performed and 1189 gene transcripts were identified. These genes were analyzed for miR-17/20/93/106 target sites in the 5′-UTRs, coding regions and 3′-UTRs. Fifty-one percent of them had miR-17/20/93/106 target sites in the 3′-UTR while 19% of them were predicted miR-17/20/93/106 targets by TargetScan. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed targeting of miR-17/20/93/106 to the 3′-UTRs of 8 out of 10 genes. In conclusion, we report a method which can establish the miRNA-targetome in untreated human cells and identify miRNA specific targets in a high throughput manner.

In this study, we first compare the properties of Type I (GSK3357679A and MLi-2) and Type II (GZD-824, Rebastinib and Ponatinib) kinase inhibitors that bind to the closed or open conformations of the LRRK2 kinase domain, respectively. We show that Type I and Type II inhibitors suppress phosphorylation of Rab10 and Rab12, key physiological substrates of LRRK2 and also promote mitophagy, a process suppressed by LRRK2. Type II inhibitors also display higher potency towards wild-type LRRK2 compared with pathogenic mutants. Unexpectedly, we find that Type II inhibitors, in contrast with Type I compounds, fail to induce dephosphorylation of a set of well-studied LRRK2 biomarker phosphorylation sites at the N-terminal region of LRRK2, including Ser935. These findings emphasize that the biomarker phosphorylation sites on LRRK2 are likely reporting on the open vs closed conformation of LRRK2 kinase and that only inhibitors which stabilize the closed conformation induce dephosphorylation of these biomarker sites. Finally, we demonstrate that the LRRK2[A2016T] mutant which is resistant to MLi-2 Type 1 inhibitor, also induces resistance to GZD-824 and Rebastinib suggesting this mutation could be exploited to distinguish off target effects of Type II inhibitors. Our observations provide a framework of knowledge to aid with the development of more selective Type II LRRK2 inhibitors"
1,On the structure of nonarchimedean analytic curves,https://core.ac.uk/works/17187512,"Let K be an algebraically closed, complete nonarchimedean field and let X be
a smooth K-curve. In this paper we elaborate on several aspects of the
structure of the Berkovich analytic space X^an. We define semistable vertex
sets of X^an and their associated skeleta, which are essentially finite metric
graphs embedded in X^an. We prove a folklore theorem which states that
semistable vertex sets of X are in natural bijective correspondence with
semistable models of X, thus showing that our notion of skeleton coincides with
the standard definition of Berkovich. We use the skeletal theory to define a
canonical metric on H(X^an) := X^an - X(K), and we give a proof of Thuillier's

3,On the GGS Conjecture,https://core.ac.uk/works/1100222,"In the 1980's, Belavin and Drinfeld classified solutions r of the classical
Yang-Baxter equation (CYBE) for simple Lie algebras \mathfrak g satisfying 0
\neq r + r_{21} \in (S^2 \mathfrak{g})^{\mathfrak{g}}. They proved that all
such solutions fall into finitely many continuous families and introduced
combinatorial objects to label these families, Belavin-Drinfeld triples. In
1993, Gerstenhaber, Giaquinto, and Schack attempted to quantize such solutions
for Lie algebras \mathfrak{sl}(n). As a result, they formulated a conjecture
stating that certain explicitly given elements R \in Mat_n(\mathbb C) \otimes
Mat_n(\mathbb C) satisfy the quantum Yang-Baxter equation (QYBE) and the Hecke
relation. Specifically, the conjecture assigns a family of such elements R to
any Belavin-Drinfeld triple of type A_{n-1}. Following a suggestion from
Gerstenhaber and Giaquinto, we propose an alternate form for R, given by R_J =
q^{r^0} J^{-1} R_s J_{21} q^{r^0}, for a suitable twist J and a diagonal matrix
r^0, where R_s is the standard Drinfeld-Jimbo solution of the QYBE. We
formulate the ``twist conjecture'', which states that R_J = R_{\text{GGS}} and
that R_J satisfies the QYBE. Since R_J by construction satisfies the Hecke
relation, this conjecture implies the GGS conjecture. We check the twist
conjecture by computer for n \leq 12 and show that it is true modulo \hbar^3.
We provide combinatorial formulas for coefficients in the matrices R_J,
R_{\text{GGS}} and prove both conjectures in the disjoint case---when \Gamma_1
\cap \Gamma_2 = \emptyset---and in the orthogonal generalized disjoint case,
which is a generalization of \Gamma_1 \perp \Gamma_2. Finally, we prove the
twist conjecture for the Cremmer-Gervais triple and discuss cases in which it
is known that R_J = R_{\text{GGS}}.Comment: 24 pages, AMSLaTeX. Includes an appendix by Pavel Etingof and the

7,Genetics and genomics studies of rice disease resistance and development of alternative disease management methods for bacterial panicle blight and sheath blight,https://core.ac.uk/works/63367454,"Bacterial panicle blight (BPB) and sheath blight (SB), caused by the bacteria Burkholderia glumae and B. gladioli, and the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, respectively, are two major rice diseases in southern rice growing regions of US. No completely resistant rice cultivars have been identified for these diseases. However, a medium-grain cultivar, Jupiter, showed partial resistance to BPB. In order to understand the mechanisms of rice resistance against BPB and SB, rice genetics and genomics studies have been conducted. Alternative methods to suppress BPB and SB were also studied. Broad-sense heritability and correlations were calculated for the traits, BPB and SB disease ratings, days to heading, and plant height, with recombinant inbred lines generated from a cross between Trenasse and Jupiter in replicated trials for two years. Days to heading and plant height had high heritability, and were negatively correlated with BPB and SB disease ratings. The traits with high heritability will not have environmental influence, and can be used as indirect selection tools. Study on genomic characteristics of five rice genotypes grown in Louisiana using their whole genome sequence data provides genome-wide DNA polymorphisms among them. These information will enable us to understand genetic elements for phenotypic variations among these genotypes, which will help to enhance the genetic studies of US rice cultivars. The sequence data were also used to develop microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphism markers, which can be used for genetic mapping studies. Previous microarray studies showed that the gene encoding a NAC4-like transcription factor, named bacterial panicle blight response gene 1 (BPR1), was highly up-regulated in Jupiter upon B. glumae inoculation. Expression of BPR1 in response to B. glumae was not detected in both Jupiter and Trenasse at seedling and tillering stages. However, rapid induction of BPR1 expression was observed in Jupiter, but not in Trenasse, when it was treated with B. glumae or chemicals, such as ascorbic acid and jasmonic acid, at its heading stage, suggesting that BPR1 expression is tissue-specific, and might be involved in rice defense response against B. gluame. Several rice-associated bacteria (RAB) isolated from healthy rice leaves were tested for their ability to suppress BPB and SB in rice. Those RAB were able to suppress bacterial cell growth and sclerotia germination in vitro, and were able to reduce the BPB and SB symptoms in rice in the field. Based on the 16S rDNA sequencing analysis, those RABs were identified as Bacillus and Lysinibacillus spp., and are potential candidates for biological control agents"
8,Global gene expression in endometrium of high and low fertility heifers during the mid-luteal phase of the estrous cycle,https://core.ac.uk/works/19111263,"peer-reviewedBackground
                In both beef and dairy cattle, the majority of early embryo loss occurs within the first 14 days following insemination. During this time-period, embryos are completely dependent on their maternal uterine environment for development, growth and ultimately survival, therefore an optimum uterine environment is critical to their survival. The objective of this study was to investigate whether differences in endometrial gene expression during the mid-luteal phase of the estrous cycle exist between crossbred beef heifers ranked as either high (HF) or low fertility (LF) (following four rounds of artificial insemination (AI)) using the Affymetrix® 23 K Bovine Gene Chip.
              
              
                Results
                Conception rates for each of the four rounds of AI were within a normal range: 70–73.3%. Microarray analysis of endometrial tissue collected on day 7 of the estrous cycle detected 419 differentially expressed genes (DEG) between HF (n = 6) and LF (n = 6) animals. The main gene pathways affected were, cellular growth and proliferation, angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, cellular and tissue morphology and development, inflammation and metabolic exchange. DEG included, FST, SLC45A2, MMP19, FADS1 and GALNT6.
              
              
                Conclusions
                This study highlights, some of the molecular mechanisms potentially controlling uterine endometrial function during the mid-luteal phase of the estrous cycle, which may contribute to uterine endometrial mediated impaired fertility in cattle. Differentially expressed genes are potential candidate genes for the identification of genetic variation influencing cow fertility, which may be incorporated into future breeding programmes.Teagasc Walsh Fellowship Programm"
9,Genome-Wide Analysis Reveals Selection Signatures Involved in Meat Traits and Local Adaptation in Semi-Feral Maremmana Cattle,https://core.ac.uk/works/46852479,"The Maremmana cattle is an ancient Podolian-derived Italian breed raised in semi-wild conditions with distinctive morphological and adaptive traits. The aim of this study was to detect potential selection signatures in Maremmana using medium-density single nucleotide polymorphism array. Putative selection signatures were investigated combining three statistical approaches designed to quantify the excess of haplotype homozygosity either within (integrated haplotype score, iHS) or among pairs of populations (Rsb and XP-EHH), and contrasting the Maremmana with a single reference population composed of a pool of seven Podolian-derived Italian breeds. Overall, the three haplotype-based analyses revealed selection signatures distributed over 19 genomic regions. Of these, six relevant candidate regions were identified by at least two approaches. We found genomic signatures of selective sweeps spanning genes related to mitochondrial function, muscle development, growth, and meat traits (SCIN, THSD7A, ETV1, UCHL1, and MYOD1), which reflects the different breeding schemes between Maremmana (semi-wild conditions) and the other Podolian-derived Italian breeds (semi-extensive). We also identified several genes linked to Maremmana adaptation to the environment of the western-central part of Italy, known to be hyperendemic for malaria and other tick-borne diseases. These include several chemokine (C-C motif) ligand genes crucially involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses to intracellular parasite infections and other genes playing key roles in pulmonary disease (HEATR9, MMP28, and ASIC2) or strongly associated with malaria resistance/susceptibility (AP2B1). Our results provide a glimpse into diverse selection signatures in Maremmana cattle and can be used to enhance our understanding of the genomic basis of environmental adaptation in cattle"

for closed subschemes of toric varieties. Let KKK be a complete non-Archimedean

the tropical skeleton of XXX as the subset of the associated Berkovich space
XanX^{\rm an}Xan which collects all Shilov boundary points in the fibers of the
Kajiwara--Payne tropicalization map. We develop polyhedral criteria for limit
points to belong to the tropical skeleton, and for the tropical skeleton to be
closed. We apply the limit point criteria to the question of continuity of the
canonical section of the tropicalization map on the multiplicity-one locus.
This map is known to be continuous on all torus orbits; we prove criteria for
continuity when crossing torus orbits. When XXX is sch\""on and defined over a
discretely valued field, we show that the tropical skeleton coincides with a

2,The Interaction Properties of the Human Rab GTPase Family – A Comparative Analysis Reveals Determinants of Molecular Binding Selectivity,https://core.ac.uk/works/4044656,"Rab GTPases constitute the largest subfamily of the Ras protein superfamily. Rab proteins regulate organelle biogenesis and transport, and display distinct binding preferences for effector and activator proteins, many of which have not been elucidated yet. The underlying molecular recognition motifs, binding partner preferences and selectivities are not well understood.Comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences and the three-dimensional electrostatic and hydrophobic molecular interaction fields of 62 human Rab proteins revealed a wide range of binding properties with large differences between some Rab proteins. This analysis assists the functional annotation of Rab proteins 12, 14, 26, 37 and 41 and provided an explanation for the shared function of Rab3 and 27. Rab7a and 7b have very different electrostatic potentials, indicating that they may bind to different effector proteins and thus, exert different functions. The subfamily V Rab GTPases which are associated with endosome differ subtly in the interaction properties of their switch regions, and this may explain exchange factor specificity and exchange kinetics.We have analysed conservation of sequence and of molecular interaction fields to cluster and annotate the human Rab proteins. The analysis of three dimensional molecular interaction fields provides detailed insight that is not available from a sequence-based approach alone. Based on our results, we predict novel functions for some Rab proteins and provide insights into their divergent functions and the determinants of their binding partner selectivity"

Evidence links this disorder with mitochondrial dysfunction and/or impaired lysosomal degradation – key features of the autophagy of mitochondria, known as mitophagy. Here, we investigated the role of LRRK2, a protein kinase frequently mutated in PD, in this process in vivo. Using mitophagy and autophagy reporter mice, bearing either knockout of LRRK2 or expressing the pathogenic kinase-activating G2019S LRRK2 mutation, we found that basal mitophagy was specifically altered in clinically relevant cells and tissues. Our data show that basal mitophagy inversely correlates with LRRK2 kinase activity in vivo. In support of this, use of distinct LRRK2 kinase inhibitors in cells increased basal mitophagy, and a CNS penetrant LRRK2 kinase inhibitor, GSK3357679A, rescued the mitophagy defects observed in LRRK2 G2019S mice. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that pathogenic LRRK2 directly impairs basal mitophagy, a process with strong links to idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, and demonstrates that pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 is a rational mitophagy-rescue approach and potential PD therapy"

A weighted average for the most prevalent macrophytes during each sampling event since spring 1995 was calculated. Results indicate that the three most common seagrasses observed in Florida Bay, Thalassia testudinum, Halodule wrightii, and Syringodium filiforme, have increased in distribution since 1995. Halodule wrightii and Syringodium filiforme exhibited an increase in both frequency and cover at the bay-scale, an occurrence driven by their dramatic increases in the western-most FHAP study basins: Johnson and Rabbit Key Basins. Acetabularia, Batophora, Halimeda, and Penicillus also exhibited increases in both frequency and cover since spring 1995. The drift Rhodophytes increased in density and distribution between spring 1995 and spring 1998, but did not increase further after that time. Batophora proved to be the most ubiquitous macroalgae throughout Florida Bay and Acetabularia and the drift Rhodophytes showed the strongest seasonal fluctuations, as they were both much more abundant and widespread during spring samplings.
Spearman rank order correlation analysis of the Braun-Blanquet cover data showed that Thalassia was generally negatively correlated to all other macrophytes, while Halodule, Halophila, and Syringodium were positively correlated to one another on most occasions. These seagrasses fluctuated between positive and negative correlations with the macroalgae, and as a group, the macroalgae were positively correlated with one another on most occasions, although exceptions did apply.
Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to create ordination plots of the ~ 315 sample stations. Density overlays were used in conjunction with these ordination plots, and together these showed that total seagrass cover and total macroalgal cover were generally mutually exclusive. Spearman rank order correlation analysis was further used to determine if this spatial separation of the two macrophyte groups was statistically significant at the bay-scale, and it was found that 11 of the 18 bi-annual sampling events yielded a statistically significant negative correlation between total seagrass cover and total macroalgae cover.
Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to determine which, if any, of the environmental/physical variables, collected as part of the FHAP data set, had a significant effect on macrophyte distribution within Florida Bay. Significance of these effects was determined using Monte Carlo Permutation Tests. CCA showed that depth and visibility were the initial driving forces in macrophyte distribution. During fall 2000, however, a spike in salinity was observed and by spring 2001 this became the most significant variable affecting macrophyte distribution, and it remained so, along with depth, throughout the duration of FHAP"

Despite their role in protecting the host from infection, many pathogens have developed ways to hijack the macrophage and use the cell for their own survival and proliferation. This includes the parasites Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania mexicana. In order to gain further understanding of how these pathogens interact with the host macrophage, we compared macrophages that have been infected with these parasites to macrophages that have been stimulated in a number of different ways. Macrophages can be activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including common motifs found on pathogens (known as pathogen associated molecular patterns or PAMPs) and cytokines secreted by other immune cells. In this study, we have delineated the relationships between the macrophage activation programs elicited by a number of cytokines and PAMPs. Furthermore, we have placed the macrophage responses to T. cruzi and L. mexicana into the context of these activation programs, providing a better understanding of the interactions between these pathogens and macrophages"
9,The MicroRNA and MessengerRNA Profile of the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex in Human Primary Astrocyte and Astrocytoma Cells,https://core.ac.uk/works/3845175,"GW/P bodies are cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein-rich foci involved in microRNA (miRNA)-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) silencing and degradation. The mRNA regulatory functions within GW/P bodies are mediated by GW182 and its binding partner hAgo2 that bind miRNA in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). To date there are no published reports of the profile of miRNA and mRNA targeted to the RISC or a comparison of the RISC-specific miRNA/mRNA profile differences in malignant and non-malignant cells.RISC mRNA and miRNA components were profiled by microarray analysis of malignant human U-87 astrocytoma cells and its non-malignant counterpart, primary human astrocytes. Total cell RNA as well as RNA from immunoprecipitated RISC was analyzed. The novel findings were fourfold: (1) miRNAs were highly enriched in astrocyte RISC compared to U-87 astrocytoma RISC, (2) astrocytoma and primary astrocyte cells each contained unique RISC miRNA profiles as compared to their respective cellular miRNA profiles, (3) miR-195, 10b, 29b, 19b, 34a and 455-3p levels were increased and the miR-181b level was decreased in U-87 astrocytoma RISC as compared to astrocyte RISC, and (4) the RISC contained decreased levels of mRNAs in primary astrocyte and U-87 astrocytoma cells.The observation that miR-34a and miR-195 levels were increased in the RISC of U-87 astrocytoma cells suggests an oncogenic role for these miRNAs. Differential regulation of mRNAs by specific miRNAs is evidenced by the observation that three miR34a-targeted mRNAs and two miR-195-targeted mRNAs were downregulated while one miR-195-targeted mRNA was upregulated. Biological pathway analysis of RISC mRNA components suggests that the RISC plays a pivotal role in malignancy and other conditions. This study points to the importance of the RISC and ultimately GW/P body composition and function in miRNA and mRNA deregulation in astrocytoma cells and possibly in other malignancies"

pluricanonical bundles which coincides with Temkin's canonical metric in the
smooth case. The weight functions are defined in terms of log discrepancies,
which makes the Kontsevich-Soibelman and essential skeletons computable: this
allows us to relate the essential skeleton to its discretely-valued
counterpart, and explicitly describe the closure of the Kontsevich-Soibelman
skeletons. As a result, we employ these techniques to compute the dual boundary

3,Evolutionary and Developmental Survey of Genes Involved in Chordate Pigmentation,https://core.ac.uk/works/8055524,"The pigmentation represents one of the most interesting topics in animal life because it is a decisive factor for the evolutionary success and the conquest of new ecological niches. Through the combination of developmental biology and comparative genomics, some aspects of pigmentary dynamics have been studied.



Given Rabs regulate a plethora of trafficking steps, the members belonging to this family are central to the transport of molecules involved in pigmentation. Moreover, comprehending the evolution of Rab family is relevant to understand the establishment of eukaryotic cellular organization and for its implication in many human pathologies. For the first time, I reconstructed the evolutionary scenario of Rab family in eleven species of metazoans, spanning from cnidarians to human. Phylogeny, intron code and synteny conservation prompted me to depict Rab evolution, with a special focus on chordates that exhibit a highly dynamic evolutionary pattern.



I clarified the evolution of Rab32/38 subfamily, fundamental in regulation of trafficking related to melanogenesis. It has been clarified the evolutionary history of Rab32/38 genes in deuterostomes and the expression pattern in key species as zebrafish and amphioxus, demonstrating how events as whole-genome duplications have influenced their role during embryogenesis.



In order to find new genes involved in pigmentation, I analyzed a Kelch-like member in ascidian Ciona robusta (Cr-Klhl21). My results point at this gene as a marker of pigmented cells, with a dynamic expression profile during embryogenesis: from middle tailbud stage, it is expressed specifically in the otolith. Moreover, Cr-Klhl21 shows an intricate regulatory scenario with the possible intervention of a transcription factors combination (Cr-Mitf, Cr-msxb, Cr-Dmrt). This work contains first data about a Kelch-like member in ascidians, providing new insights in pigmentation or pigment cell specification.

4,"Analysis of Hepatocyte Secretion Pathways: A Case Study on Hepatic Apolipoproteins, Serum Albumin, and Hepatitis C Virus",https://core.ac.uk/works/47663115,"The hepatocyte is one of the major secretory cell types in the body. It fulfills many of the liver\u27s essential functions in protein secretion, lipid storage and transport, and excretion. Some of these functions are carried out via polarized secretion of simple protein cargo, such as serum albumin, or large macromolecular lipid-protein complexes, the lipoproteins. The hepatocyte is also the site of infection of several hepatotropic viruses. Of these, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is peculiar due to its close structural and functional association with the hepatic lipoproteins. All these cargoes are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface by the vesicular secretory pathway, yet insufficient knowledge exists regarding the molecular regulation of their secretion by the hepatocyte. Furthermore, differential modalities of regulation may be involved in the shuttling of such a diverse set of cargoes as albumin, the lipoproteins and HCV.  The work presented here head-starts a comprehensive examination of how the hepatocyte regulates the secretion of the following cargoes: serum albumin, the apolipoproteins E and B100 (ApoE and ApoB100, respectively, both lipoprotein components, and surrogate markers for these complex macromolecular particles), and HCV, a lipoprotein-associated virus. I propose to combine genetic, biochemical, virological and imaging approaches to identify which vesicular secretory pathways are utilized by each of these cargoes. These approaches include inactivation of specific vesicular transport pathways, accompanied by measurements of their effects on cargo secretion efficiencies, and establishment of functional fluorescent protein-tagged cargo markers to be used in live cell imaging experiments. I begin by describing a dominant negative (DN) Rab GTPase screen that I  performed to identify Rab proteins involved in ApoE, ApoB100 or albumin secretion.  The small Rab GTPases control individual steps of vesicular transport. I analyzed how expression of individual dominant negative Rab proteins affected cargo secretion compared to expression of their wild type (WT) counterparts. I identified several Rabs that caused significant changes in secretion, many of which had previously been described as regulators of various exocytic vesicular transport steps.  I next present ongoing work that aims to define the involvement of the Rabs 11a, 11b, 8a, and 8b in hepatic cargo secretion. Their dominant negative mutants exhibited some of the largest secretion phenotypes in my dominant negative Rab screen. These Rabs have been implicated in various aspects of post-Golgi secretion in polarized and non-polarized cell types. I thus discuss the implications of their involvement in cargo secretion in the polarized hepatocyte and outline my ongoing efforts to define the parameters of this involvement.  I also investigated the function of Rab1b in hepatic secretion. I show that inactivation of Rab1 function, by expression of a set of dominant negative mutants, or by expression of a bacterial effector which affects Rab1 function, led to impairment of albumin, ApoE, ApoB100 and HCV secretion. I implicate Rab1, for the first time to my knowledge, in the transport of these cargoes. I also document differences in the sensitivity of cargo secretion to the various means of Rab1 inactivation. ApoE secretion, in particular, was insensitive to several means of transport inactivation, consistent with existing models of differential regulation of hepatic cargo transport.  Lastly, I functionally characterize an ApoE-green fluorescent protein fusion (ApoE-GFP). I show that while ApoE-GFP does not support infectious HCV release, a hallmark function of untagged ApoE, ApoE-GFP nevertheless reproduces several known behaviors of ApoE that have been associated with lipoprotein release. I thus conclude that ApoE-GFP may be a useful marker for live cell imaging of lipoprotein release.  This work therefore identifies potential regulators of hepatic cargo transport, establishes molecular tools useful for the continued study of cargo secretion in hepatocytes and elsewhere, and advances the understanding of the involvement of Rabs 11, 8, and, in particular, Rab1, in the regulation of hepatic cargo transport. I propose that this work forms a solid foundation for extensive studies on how these biomedically relevant hepatic cargoes are secreted"
5,Complex polarity: building multicellular tissues through apical membrane traffic,https://core.ac.uk/works/26535902,"The formation of distinct subdomains of the cell surface is crucial for multicellular organism development. The most striking example of this is apical-basal polarization. What is much less appreciated is that underpinning an asymmetric cell surface is an equally dramatic intracellular endosome rearrangement. Here, we review the interplay between classical cell polarity proteins and membrane trafficking pathways, and discuss how this marriage gives rise to cell polarization. We focus on those mechanisms that regulate apical polarization, as this is providing a number of insights into how membrane traffic and polarity are regulated at the tissue level"
6,EGFR is required for Wnt9a-Fzd9b signalling specificity in haematopoietic stem cells.,https://core.ac.uk/works/85859978,"Wnt signalling drives many processes in development, homeostasis and disease; however, the role and mechanism of individual ligand-receptor (Wnt-Frizzled (Fzd)) interactions in specific biological processes remain poorly understood. Wnt9a is specifically required for the amplification of blood progenitor cells during development. Using genetic studies in zebrafish and human embryonic stem cells, paired with in vitro cell biology and biochemistry, we determined that Wnt9a signals specifically through Fzd9b to elicit β-catenin-dependent Wnt signalling that regulates haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell emergence. We demonstrate that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is required as a cofactor for Wnt9a-Fzd9b signalling. EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of one tyrosine residue on the Fzd9b intracellular tail in response to Wnt9a promotes internalization of the Wnt9a-Fzd9b-LRP signalosome and subsequent signal transduction. These findings provide mechanistic insights for specific Wnt-Fzd signals, which will be crucial for specific therapeutic targeting and regenerative medicine"
7,VISCOELASTIC CHARACTERIZATION OF RABBIT NUCLEUS PULPOSUS TISSUE IN TORSIONAL CREEP,https://core.ac.uk/works/5240027,"Recently, molecular therapy approaches have been shown to favorably alter the course of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) in a rabbit model. Typical experimental outcome measures for the rabbit model of IDD include MRI, x-ray, histology, and gene expression. Biomechanical function is another desirable parameter through which to compare treatments, although this is difficult due to limited availability of data for small animal models. In the current study, nucleus pulposus tissue was taken from the healthy rabbit intervertebral disc and tested in torsional creep to establish a database of healthy tissue behavior for future use in assessing the functional efficacy of molecular therapy treatments of IDD. Nucleus pulposus tissue was excised from the L5-L6 intervertebral disc, mounted between the cone and plate of an AR1000 Rheometer, and various torsional creep experiments were performed. Several creep models were fit to the data and modeling analyses were conducted. Of the models compared, the Andrade creep model provides the most reliable data extrapolation. It appears that the tissue is nonlinearly viscoelastic since it does not adhere to the Boltzmann superposition principle. A nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive model, derived for Andrade creep and used to predict the strain behavior obtained at higher levels of stress, provides consistent prediction results. The application of this model to degenerated rabbit NP tissue is expected to result in altered model parameters - thus providing quantifiable, functional benchmarks of success for molecular therapy approaches to the treatment of IDD"
8,Pericentrosomal targeting of Rab6 secretory vesicles by Bicaudal-D-related protein 1 (BICDR-1) regulates neuritogenesis,https://core.ac.uk/works/3804404,"Membrane and secretory trafficking are essential for proper neuronal development. However, the molecular mechanisms that organize secretory trafficking are poorly understood. Here, we identify Bicaudal-D-related protein 1 (BICDR-1) as an effector of the small GTPase Rab6 and key component of the molecular machinery that controls secretory vesicle transport in developing neurons. BICDR-1 interacts with kinesin motor Kif1C, the dynein/dynactin retrograde motor complex, regulates the pericentrosomal localization of Rab6-positive secretory vesicles and is required for neural development in zebrafish. BICDR-1 expression is high during early neuronal development and strongly declines during neurite outgrowth. In young neurons, BICDR-1 accumulates Rab6 secretory vesicles around the centrosome, restricts anterograde secretory transport and inhibits neuritogenesis. Later during development, BICDR-1 expression is strongly reduced, which permits anterograde secretory transport required for neurite outgrowth. These results indicate an important role for BICDR-1 as temporal regulator of secretory trafficking during the early phase of neuronal differentiation"

It is a life-threatening condition, often requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). The causative agents and processes involved are multifactorial but are characterized by an overarching inflammatory response, sharing elements in common with severe inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) of non-infectious origin. Sepsis presents with a range of pathophysiological and genetic features which make clinical differentiation from SIRS very challenging. This may reflect a poor understanding of the key gene inter-activities and/or pathway associations underlying these disease processes. Improved understanding is critical for early differential recognition of sepsis and SIRS and to improve patient management and clinical outcomes. Judicious selection of gene biomarkers suitable for development of diagnostic tests/testing could make differentiation of sepsis and SIRS feasible. Here we describe a methodologic framework for the identification and validation of biomarkers in SIRS, sepsis and septic shock patients, using a 2-tier gene screening, artificial neural network (ANN) data mining technique, using previously published gene expression datasets. Eight key hub markers have been identified which may delineate distinct, core disease processes and which show potential for informing underlying immunological and pathological processes and thus patient stratification and treatment. These do not show sufficient fold change differences between the different disease states to be useful as primary diagnostic biomarkers, but are instrumental in identifying candidate pathways and other associated biomarkers for further exploration"

It looks at the question from the perspective of the law and economics approach. We seek to identify the comparative benefits of using the criminal law relative to other enforcement mechanisms and – more broadly – why certain specific behaviours are criminalized. The paper argues that an economic approach emphasizing the relative merits of alternative legal instruments for bringing about harm reduction can provide an explanation for a number of recent legal developments. It argues also that the willingness of legislators to combine the use of sanctions traditionally used in one area of the law with sanctions from other areas is more readily explicable in economic terms than in other terms."

  We put the earlier proposed in our work first order (connection)

excluding the connections it is consistent with the above Faddeev action on the

a way to fix the value of this action on the piecewise constant ansatz on

The disease is heterogeneous, including different subsets of patients distinguished by LGL immunophenotype (CD8+ T\u3b1\u3b2, CD4+ T\u3b1\u3b2, T\u3b3\u3b4, NK) and the clinical course of the disease (indolent/symptomatic/aggressive). Even if the etiology of LGLL remains elusive, evidence is accumulating on the genetic landscape driving and/or sustaining chronic LGL proliferations. The most common gain-of-function mutations identified in LGLL patients are on STAT3 and STAT5b genes, which have been recently recognized as clonal markers and were included in the 2017 WHO classification of the disease. A significant correlation between STAT3 mutations and symptomatic disease has been highlighted. At variance, STAT5b mutations could have a different clinical impact based on the immunophenotype of the mutated clone. In fact, they are regarded as the signature of an aggressive clinical course with a poor prognosis in CD8+ T-LGLL and aggressive NK cell leukemia, while they are devoid of negative prognostic significance in CD4+ T-LGLL and T\u3b3\u3b4 LGLL. Knowing the specific distribution of STAT mutations helps identify the discrete mechanisms sustaining LGL proliferations in the corresponding disease subsets. Some patients equipped with wild type STAT genes are characterized by less frequent mutations in different genes, suggesting that other pathogenetic mechanisms are likely to be involved. In this review, we discuss how the LGLL mutational pattern allows a more precise and detailed tumor stratification, suggesting new parameters for better management of the disease and hopefully paving the way for a targeted clinical approach"

The success of identifying genetic susceptibility loci for PA, a multi-factorial heritable disorder, has been limited. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and candidate gene association study using 470 PA cases and 473 controls from Lima, Peru. Genotyping for common genetic variations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) was conducted using the Illumina Cardio-Metabo Chip platform. Common variations in 35 genes that participate in mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) and oxidative phosphorylation (OS) were selected for the candidate gene study. Regression models were fit to examine associations of each SNP with risk of PA. In pathway analyses, we examined functions and functional relationships of genes represented by the top GWAS hits. Genetic risk scores (GRS), based on top hits of the GWAS and candidate gene analyses, respectively, were computed using the risk allele counting method. The top hit in the GWAS analyses was rs1238566 (empirical P-value=1.04e-4 and FDR-adjusted P-value=5.65E-04) in FLI-1 gene, a megakaryocyte-specific transcription factor. Networks of genes involved in lipid metabolism and cell signaling were significantly enriched by the 51 genes whose SNPs were among the top 200 GWAS hits. SNPs known to regulate MB (e.g. CAMK2B, NR1H3, PPARG, PRKCA, and THRB) and OP (e.g., COX5A, and NDUF family of genes) were associated with PA risk. GRS was significantly associated with PA risk.

However, the details of the intracellular trafficking pathway of nanoparticles in cells have been poorly investigated. Here, we investigate in detail the intracellular trafficking pathway of protein nanocapsules using more than 30 Rab proteins as markers of multiple trafficking vesicles in endocytosis, exocytosis and autophagy. We observed that FITC-labeled protein nanoparticles were internalized by the cells mainly through Arf6-dependent endocytosis and Rab34-mediated micropinocytosis. In addition to this classic pathway: early endosome (EEs)/late endosome (LEs) to lysosome, we identified two novel transport pathways: micropinocytosis (Rab34 positive)-LEs (Rab7 positive)-lysosome pathway and EEs-liposome (Rab18 positive)-lysosome pathway. Moreover, the cells use slow endocytosis recycling pathway (Rab11 and Rab35 positive vesicles) and GLUT4 exocytosis vesicles (Rab8 and Rab10 positive) transport the protein nanocapsules out of the cells. In addition, protein nanoparticles are observed in autophagosomes, which receive protein nanocapsules through multiple endocytosis vesicles. Using autophagy inhibitor to block these transport pathways could prevent the degradation of nanoparticles through lysosomes. Using Rab proteins as vesicle markers to investigation the detail intracellular trafficking of the protein nanocapsules, will provide new targets to interfere the cellular behaver of the nanoparticles, and improve the therapeutic effect of nanomedicine"

This process is required for a diversity of cellular events, including neuronal morphology acquisition and functional regulation, among others. The recycling endosome (RE) is a key vesicular component involved in endocytic recycling. Recycling back to the cell surface may occur with the participation of several different Rab proteins, which are master regulators of membrane/protein trafficking in nerve cells. The RE consists of a network of interconnected and functionally distinct tubular subdomains that originate from sorting endosomes and transport their cargoes along microtubule tracks, by fast or slow recycling pathways. Different populations of REs, particularly those formed by Rab11, Rab35, and Arf6, are associated with a myriad of signaling proteins. In this review, we discuss the cumulative evidence suggesting the existence of heterogeneous domains of REs, controlling different aspects of neurogenesis, with a particular focus on the commonalities and singularities of these REs and their contribution to nerve development and differentiation in several animal models.Fil: Rozés Salvador, María Victoria.

8,The RAB2B-GARIL5 Complex Promotes Cytosolic DNA-Induced Innate Immune Responses,https://core.ac.uk/works/96977815,"Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that induces the IFN antiviral response. However, the regulatory mechanisms that mediate cGAS-triggered signaling have not been fully explored. Here, we show the involvement of a small GTPase, RAB2B, and its effector protein, Golgi-associated RAB2B interactor-like 5 (GARIL5), in the cGAS-mediated IFN response. RAB2B-deficiency affects the IFN response induced by cytosolic DNA. Consistent with this, RAB2B deficiency enhances replication of vaccinia virus, a DNA virus. After DNA stimulation, RAB2B colocalizes with stimulator of interferon genes (STING), the downstream signal mediator of cGAS, on the Golgi apparatus. The GTP-binding activity of RAB2B is required for its localization on the Golgi apparatus and for recruitment of GARIL5. GARIL5 deficiency also affects the IFN response induced by cytosolic DNA and enhances replication of vaccinia virus. These findings indicate that the RAB2B-GARIL5 complex promotes IFN responses against DNA viruses by regulating the cGAS-STING signaling axis"
9,"Homogeneous and Isotropic Cosmology, the Schwarzschild Solution, and Applications",https://core.ac.uk/works/69648339,"Classically, the physics of the universe is described by Newton\u27s Laws of Motion and Newton\u27s Law of Universal Gravitation. In most cases, the results predicted by Newton\u27s theories accurately agree with experimental observations. However, under certain limitations, classical theories may yield slight deviation from observations, such as when the speed of an object approaches the speed of light. At the extreme, classical theory completely fails to explain the motion of photons, which are massless particles of light. In 1915, Albert Einstein published the General Theory of Relativity. Einstein\u27s theory provides a new perspective to a better understanding of the physics describing this universe. In this paper, we attempt to introduce some of the prerequisite material in differential geometry and investigate the general theory of relativity, along with some of its solutions from a mathematical point of view. We study homogeneous and isotropic cosmology, and the Schwarzschild solution. Finally, we will discuss some of their applications and significance"
0,Genome-wide significant loci for addiction and anxiety,https://core.ac.uk/works/89847728,"Background Psychiatric comorbidity is common among individuals with addictive disorders, with patients frequently suffering from anxiety disorders. While the genetic architecture of comorbid addictive and anxiety disorders remains unclear, elucidating the genes involved could provide important insights into the underlying etiology.  Methods Here we examine a sample of 1284 Mexican-Americans from randomly selected extended pedigrees. Variance decomposition methods were used to examine the role of genetics in addiction phenotypes (lifetime history of alcohol dependence, drug dependence or chronic smoking) and various forms of clinically relevant anxiety. Genome-wide univariate and bivariate linkage scans were conducted to localize the chromosomal regions influencing these traits.  Results Addiction phenotypes and anxiety were shown to be heritable and univariate genome-wide linkage scans revealed significant quantitative trait loci for drug dependence (14q13.2-q21.2, LOD = 3.322) and a broad anxiety phenotype (12q24.32-q24.33, LOD = 2.918). Significant positive genetic correlations were observed between anxiety and each of the addiction subtypes (ρg = 0.550–0.655) and further investigation with bivariate linkage analyses identified significant pleiotropic signals for alcohol dependence-anxiety (9q33.1-q33.2, LOD = 3.054) and drug dependence-anxiety (18p11.23-p11.22, LOD = 3.425).  Conclusions This study confirms the shared genetic underpinnings of addiction and anxiety and identifies genomic loci involved in the etiology of these comorbid disorders. The linkage signal for anxiety on 12q24 spans the location of TMEM132D, an emerging gene of interest from previous GWAS of anxiety traits, whilst the bivariate linkage signal identified for anxiety-alcohol on 9q33 peak coincides with a region where rare CNVs have been associated with psychiatric disorders. Other signals identified implicate novel regions of the genome in addiction genetics"
1,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Is Accompanied by Protein Derangements in the Olfactory Bulb-Tract Axis,https://core.ac.uk/works/14082404,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by progressive muscle paralysis due to the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Recent studies point out an involvement of the non-motor axis during disease progression. Despite smell impairment being considered a potential non-motor finding in ALS, the pathobiochemistry at the olfactory level remains unknown. Here, we applied an olfactory quantitative proteotyping approach to analyze the magnitude of the olfactory bulb (OB) proteostatic imbalance in ALS subjects (n = 12) with respect to controls (n = 8). Around 3% of the quantified OB proteome was differentially expressed, pinpointing aberrant protein expression involved in vesicle-mediated transport, macroautophagy, axon development and gliogenesis in ALS subjects. The overproduction of olfactory marker protein (OMP) points out an imbalance in the olfactory signal transduction in ALS. Accompanying the specific overexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Bcl-xL in the olfactory tract (OT), a tangled disruption of signaling routes was evidenced across the OB-OT axis in ALS. In particular, the OB survival signaling dynamics clearly differ between ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), two faces of TDP-43 proteinopathy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on high-throughput molecular characterization of the olfactory proteostasis in ALS"

4,Optineurin Dysfunction in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Why So Puzzling?,https://core.ac.uk/works/109518458,"Mutations in optineurin have been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) a decade ago, but its exact role in the neurodegenerative process is still unclear. As a lysine 63 (K63) and methionine (M1) poly-ubiquitin binding protein, optineurin has been reported to act as an adaptor in inflammatory signaling pathways mediated via nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), as well as in membrane-associated trafficking events including autophagy, maintenance of the Golgi apparatus, and exocytosis. Other studies have demonstrated its role in other processes such as regulation of mitosis, transcription, necroptosis and apoptosis. However, many of the reported effects in cell models have been proven difficult to reproduce in optineurin animal models, demonstrating the challenges of extrapolation between model systems. Knowing that multifunctional proteins present a “nightmare” for researchers, to help navigating through this field, we address the most common controversies, open questions, and artefacts related to optineurin and its role in pathogenesis of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p"

6,Dissecting the Physiological Roles of ULK1/2 in the Mouse Brain,https://core.ac.uk/works/69979323,"Mammalian UNC-51–like kinases 1 and 2 (ULK1 and ULK2), Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-51 and Drosophila melanogaster Atg1 are redundant serine/threonine kinases that regulate flux through the autophagy pathway in response to various types of cellular stress. C. elegans UNC-51 and D. melanogaster Atg1 also promote axonal growth and defasciculation, and disruption of these genes results in defects in axon guidance in invertebrates. Germline Ulk1/2-deficient mice die perinatally. Therefore, we used a conditional-knockout approach to investigate the roles of ULK1/2 in the brain. Mice lacking Ulk1 and Ulk2 in their central nervous systems (CNS) showed defects in axonal pathfinding and defasciculation affecting the corpus callosum (CC), anterior commissure (AC), corticothalamic axons (CTAs) and thalamocortical axons (TCAs) and mossy fibers. These defects led to impaired midline crossing of callosal axons, anterior commissure hypoplasia and disorganization of the somatosensory cortex. The axon guidance defects observed in Ulk1/2 double knockout (dko) and in CNS-specific (Nestin-Cre) Ulk1/2 conditional double knockout (cdko) mice were not recapitulated in mice lacking other autophagy genes (i.e. Atg7 or Fip200), and was associated with abnormal localization of the axon guidance molecule, transient axonal glycoprotein-1 (TAG-1) in the distal CTAs. Approximately 40% of the Ulk1/2 cdko animals died shortly after birth; the remaining animals survived up to 4 months. Although the mice showed neuronal degeneration, specifically in the hippocampal CA1 region, the neurons showed no accumulation of P62+/ubiquitin+ inclusions or abnormal membranous structures, which are observed in mice lacking other autophagy genes, such as Atg7, and Fip200. Rather, neuronal death was associated with activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. An unbiased proteomics approach identified SEC16A as a novel ULK1/2-interacting partner. ULK-mediated phosphorylation of SEC16A regulated the assembly of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites and ER-to-Golgi trafficking of specific cargo such as, the serotonin transporter SERT, and did not require other autophagy proteins (e.g. ATG13). The defect in ER-to-Golgi trafficking activated the UPR pathway in ULK-deficient cells; both processes were reversed upon expression of SEC16A with a phosphomimetic substitution. Thus, the regulation of ER-to-Golgi trafficking by ULK1/2 is essential for cellular homeostasis. Moreover, the defect in SERT trafficking may also contribute to the disrupted formation of the barrel cortex in the Ulk1/2 cdko mice. Together, these data highlight the autophagy-independent role of ULK1 and ULK2 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating axon guidance in the mammalian brain"
7,Hippocampal CA1 Transcriptional Profile of Sleep Deprivation: Relation to Aging and Stress,https://core.ac.uk/works/69229196,"BACKGROUND: Many aging changes seem similar to those elicited by sleep-deprivation and psychosocial stress. Further, sleep architecture changes with age suggest an age-related loss of sleep. Here, we hypothesized that sleep deprivation in young subjects would elicit both stress and aging-like transcriptional responses.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: F344 rats were divided into control and sleep deprivation groups. Body weight, adrenal weight, corticosterone level and hippocampal CA1 transcriptional profiles were measured. A second group of animals was exposed to novel environment stress (NES), and their hippocampal transcriptional profiles measured. A third cohort exposed to control or SD was used to validate transcriptional results with Western blots. Microarray results were statistically contrasted with prior transcriptional studies. Microarray results pointed to sleep pressure signaling and macromolecular synthesis disruptions in the hippocampal CA1 region. Animals exposed to NES recapitulated nearly one third of the SD transcriptional profile. However, the SD-aging relationship was more complex. Compared to aging, SD profiles influenced a significant subset of genes. mRNA associated with neurogenesis and energy pathways showed agreement between aging and SD, while immune, glial, and macromolecular synthesis pathways showed SD profiles that opposed those seen in aging.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that although NES and SD exert similar transcriptional changes, selective presynaptic release machinery and Homer1 expression changes are seen in SD. Among other changes, the marked decrease in Homer1 expression with age may represent an important divergence between young and aged brain response to SD. Based on this, it seems reasonable to conclude that therapeutic strategies designed to promote sleep in young subjects may have off-target effects in the aged. Finally, this work identifies presynaptic vesicular release and intercellular adhesion molecular signatures as novel therapeutic targets to counter effects of SD in young subjects"
8,Immune Regulation in Human Filariasis,https://core.ac.uk/works/85230673,"Vector transmitted diseases such as the tropical helminth infections onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF) affect more than 150 million people worldwide and are both considered major public health concerns. In order to guarantee the fulfillment of their complex lifecycle, adult filarial nematodes release millions of microfilariae (MF), which are engulfed by mosquito vectors and the current strategy to eliminate filarial infections focuses upon interrupting this transmission through annual mass drug administration (MDA). Nevertheless, repeated rounds of drug intake are needed to interrupt the lifecycle and gathering information about immunological processes could reveal alternative approaches in order to break transmission. Filariasis results in different pathological outcomes ranging from asymptomatic individuals to patients with severe pathology. Recently, a subgroup of asymptomatic latently infected patients has become apparent in LF; these individuals are amicrofilaremic despite chronic infection. With regards to immunological aspects, this subgroup has been neglected so far even though they are of special interest since they represent a roadblock in terms of parasite transmission. Moreover, immunological facets of asymptomatic microfilaremic (patent) individuals have been intensively described in the literature but usually in comparison to patients suffering from severe pathology. In onchocerciasis, most patients are patently infected and are characterized by weak or even absent inflammation. Interestingly, however, some infected individuals who lack severe pathology are amicrofilaremic and is considered to be a result of repeated MDA. Therefore, the present thesis aimed at analyzing the immune responses of a large cohort of LF or onchocerciasis infected individuals characterized by the absence or presence of MF. In addition, the signaling pathway of interleukin 10 (IL-10) was investigated since it is known from the literature that this immunosuppressive cytokine is a key player during filariasis. Results from infected individuals were compared with those from infection-free volunteers from the same endemic areas. In cases of infection with LF, immune profiles were also determined following the administration of different treatment regimes. Within this thesis it was shown that amicrofilaremic individuals could be characterized by lower parasite burden but increased immune responses with regards to their cytokine and antigen-specific immunoglobulin levels. In contrast, the presence of worm offspring was associated with a down-regulation of these immune responses but was not sufficient to induce the same immunomodulation in cells from non-endemic healthy blood donors in in vitro experiments. Moreover, analyzing gene expression profiles of regulatory, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations from individuals with patent and latent LF infection strengthened the observation that both groups of individuals cannot only be separated due to the presence or absence of MF per se but also due to differences in their immune profiles. These data provide novel insights into possible mechanisms which either actively hinder the release of MF from adult worms or their migration to the periphery in amicrofilaremic infected patients. Further research into these aspects may broaden the range of strategies currently employed to reduce transmission and in turn eliminate filariasis"

0,In vivo visual screen for dopaminergic Rab ⇿ LRRK2-G2019S interactions in Drosophila discriminates Rab10 from Rab3,https://core.ac.uk/works/8438618,"LRRK2 mutations cause Parkinson’s, but the molecular link from increased kinase activity to pathological neurodegeneration remains undetermined. Previous in vitro assays indicate that LRRK2 substrates include at least 8 Rab GTPases. We have now examined this hypothesis in vivo in a functional, electroretinogram screen, expressing each Rab with/without LRRK2-G2019S in selected Drosophila dopaminergic neurons. Our screen discriminated Rab10 from Rab3. The strongest Rab/LRRK2-G2019S interaction is with Rab10; the weakest with Rab3. Rab10 is expressed in a different set of dopaminergic neurons from Rab3. Thus, anatomical and physiological patterns of Rab10 are related. We conclude that Rab10 is a valid substrate of LRRK2 in dopaminergic neurons in vivo. We propose that variations in Rab expression contribute to differences in the rate of neurodegeneration recorded in different dopaminergic nuclei in Parkinson’s"
1,Gene Regulatory Pathways Driving Central Nervous System Regeneration in Zebrafish,https://core.ac.uk/works/63209515,"Damage to the central nervous system (CNS) circuitry of adult mammals results in permanent disability. In contrast, the ability to regenerate damaged CNS nerves and achieve functional recovery occurs naturally in fish. The ability of fish to successfully regrow damaged CNS nerves is in part a consequence of their ability to re-express key neuronal growth-associated genes/proteins in response to CNS injury. On such protein is Growth-Associated Protein-43 (Gap43), a protein which is highly enriched in axonal growth cones during CNS development and regeneration. Experiments conducted in mammals have demonstrated that ectopic expression of GAP-43 improves axonal re-growth after injury. Using zebrafish optic nerve as a model for successful CNS regeneration, we have identified that re-expression of the gap43 gene is crucial for regenerative axon growth in vivo. Using a combination of in vivo reporter assays and in vivo regeneration assays, we also identified transcriptional regulatory pathways that are essential for gap43 gene expression in regenerating CNS neurons. We found that transcription factors Ascl1a, Atf3, cJun and Stat3 are required for both re-initiating gap43 expression and driving axon outgrowth in response to optic nerve injury. Futhermore, our results indicate that transcription factors Ascl1a, Atf3 and cJun function cooperatively to re-initiate gap43 expression in a manner that is conserved across highly divergent teleost species. Together, these experiments provide insights into regulatory mechanisms driving successful CNS regeneration, thereby revealing potential targets that may be manipulated to improve regenerative ability in mammals"
2,Lysosomal perturbations in human dopaminergic neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells with <i>PARK2</i> mutation,https://core.ac.uk/works/88834402,"Mutations in the PARK2 gene encoding parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, are associated with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). While parkin has been implicated in the regulation of mitophagy and proteasomal degradation, the precise mechanism leading to neurodegeneration in both sporadic and familial PD upon parkin loss-of-function remains unknown. Cultures of isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with and without PARK2 knockout (KO) enable mechanistic studies of the effect of parkin deficiency in human dopaminergic neurons. We used such cells to investigate the impact of PARK2 KO on the lysosomal compartment and found a clear link between parkin deficiency and lysosomal alterations. PARK2 KO neurons exhibited a perturbed lysosomal morphology with enlarged electron-lucent lysosomes and an increased lysosomal content, which was exacerbated by mitochondrial stress and could be ameliorated by antioxidant treatment. We also found decreased lysosomal enzyme activity and autophagic perturbations, suggesting an impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in parkin-deficient cells. Interestingly, activity of the GBA-encoded enzyme, β-glucocerebrosidase, was increased, suggesting the existence of a compensatory mechanism. In conclusion, our data provide a unique characterization of the morphology, content, and function of lysosomes in PARK2 KO neurons and reveal an important new connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and lysosomal dysregulation in PD pathogenesis.Innovation Fund Denmark (BrainStem; 4108–00008 A), H.

3,Regulation of Rab8 in Toll-Like Receptor Signalling Pathways,https://core.ac.uk/works/89339034,"Small GTPases of the Rab family have wide ranging and essential roles in recruiting effectors to mediate membrane trafficking and receptor signalling events in mammalian cells. Nucleotide loading and activation/deactivation of the Rabs themselves are regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and other accessory proteins. While Rabs have important roles in innate immune cells, for host-pathogen interactions, receptor signalling and membrane trafficking, in many cases their GEFs and other accessory proteins have not been elucidated.Pathogen-activated, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) initiate and modulate transcription of inflammatory cytokines and other innate immune responses which are important for immune defence but can also contribute to chronic disease. Macrophages are key cells of the innate immune system and previous work from our laboratory established a role for promiscuous Rab family member, Rab8a, in TLR signalling. Rab8a is activated in TLR pathways to recruit phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kg) as an effector which upregulates TLR-induced Akt/mTOR signalling to drive a biased program of anti-inflammatory cytokines. TLR-associated PI3Kg has now emerged as a key mediator of macrophage programming (or polarisation) in inflammation and cancer and its cognate GTPase, Rab8a, has a prominent role in immunity and disease. Rab8a is itself recruited to macrophage ruffles and macropinosomes through its association with the TLR crosstalk-activated endocytic receptor LRP1. However, it is not yet known how Rab8a is activated in TLR pathways. This project set out to identify the essential Rab8a GEF(s) needed to activate Rab8a as part of the LRP1 complex.Two well-known Rab8 GEFs, GRAB and Rabin8, which previously were uncharacterised in macrophages, were investigated in this project. GRAB was identified as part of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) complex in pull-downs analysed by mass spectrometry. Co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy showed that both GRAB and the structurally similar GEF, Rabin8, undergo LPS-inducible binding to Rab8a and are localised at sites of Rab8a enrichment. To carry out functional studies, stable knockouts (KOs) of Rabin8, GRAB, as well as a double KO were produced via CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in macrophage cell lines. Nucleotide activation assays were developed for this project and live-cell imaging with KO cell lines showed that both GEFs contribute additively to TLR4-induced Rab8a GTP-loading, but they are not needed for Rab8a membrane recruitment. Analysis of TLR signalling after double KO of both GEFs suggested redundant roles for Rabin8 and GRAB in activating Rab8a for PI3Kg-dependent Akt/mTOR signalling. Live cell imaging utilising a fluorescent Akt1 reporter confirmed that LPS/TLR-induced Akt signalling is generated on macropinosomes and requires GRAB and Rabin8 GEF function.Next, to investigate possible regulators of the Rab8 GEFs, pull-downs and mass spectrometry were performed and identified a known multi-Rab effector, oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL) as a Rabin8 binding protein in LPS activated macrophages. Follow-up experiments provided initial characterisation of a novel OCRL-Rabin8 interaction and indicate a possible recruitment mechanism for the Rab8 GEF during TLR signalling.In conclusion, these results identified both GRAB and Rabin8 as essential activators of Rab8 downstream of TLR4 for inflammatory signalling in mouse macrophages. The results contribute these GEFs and other possible Rab recruiters to an expanding molecular complex that drives PI3Kg/Akt/mTOR signalling for control of inflammation and innate immune responses"
4,Deregulation of Rab and Rab Effector Genes in Bladder Cancer,https://core.ac.uk/works/4069962,"Growing evidence indicates that Rab GTPases, key regulators of intracellular transport in eukaryotic cells, play an important role in cancer. We analysed the deregulation at the transcriptional level of the genes encoding Rab proteins and Rab-interacting proteins in bladder cancer pathogenesis, distinguishing between the two main progression pathways so far identified in bladder cancer: the Ta pathway characterized by a high frequency of FGFR3 mutation and the carcinoma in situ pathway where no or infrequent FGFR3 mutations have been identified. A systematic literature search identified 61 genes encoding Rab proteins and 223 genes encoding Rab-interacting proteins. Transcriptomic data were obtained for normal urothelium samples and for two independent bladder cancer data sets corresponding to 152 and 75 tumors. Gene deregulation was analysed with the SAM (significant analysis of microarray) test or the binomial test. Overall, 30 genes were down-regulated, and 13 were up-regulated in the tumor samples. Five of these deregulated genes (LEPRE1, MICAL2, RAB23, STXBP1, SYTL1) were specifically deregulated in FGFR3-non-mutated muscle-invasive tumors. No gene encoding a Rab or Rab-interacting protein was found to be specifically deregulated in FGFR3-mutated tumors. Cluster analysis showed that the RAB27 gene cluster (comprising the genes encoding RAB27 and its interacting partners) was deregulated and that this deregulation was associated with both pathways of bladder cancer pathogenesis. Finally, we found that the expression of KIF20A and ZWINT was associated with that of proliferation markers and that the expression of MLPH, MYO5B, RAB11A, RAB11FIP1, RAB20 and SYTL2 was associated with that of urothelial cell differentiation markers. This systematic analysis of Rab and Rab effector gene deregulation in bladder cancer, taking relevant tumor subgroups into account, provides insight into the possible roles of Rab proteins and their effectors in bladder cancer pathogenesis. This approach is applicable to other group of genes and types of cancer"
5,Distinct Pigmentary and Melanocortin 1 Receptor–Dependent Components of Cutaneous Defense against Ultraviolet Radiation,https://core.ac.uk/works/3227846,"Genetic variation at the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is an important risk factor for developing ultraviolet (UV) radiation–induced skin cancer, the most common form of cancer in humans. The underlying mechanisms by which the MC1R defends against UV-induced skin cancer are not known. We used neonatal mouse skin (which, like human skin, contains a mixture of melanocytes and keratinocytes) to study how pigment cells and Mc1r genotype affect the genome-level response to UV radiation. Animals without viable melanocytes (Kit(W-v)/Kit(W-v)) or animals lacking a functional Mc1r (Mc1r(e)/Mc1r(e)) were exposed to sunburn-level doses of UVB radiation, and the patterns of large-scale gene expression in the basal epidermis were compared to each other and to nonmutant animals. Our analysis revealed discrete Kit- and Mc1r-dependent UVB transcriptional responses in the basal epidermis. The Kit-dependent UVB response was characterized largely by an enrichment of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress genes, highlighting a distinctive role for pigmented melanocytes in mediating antioxidant defenses against genotoxic stresses within the basal epidermal environment. By contrast, the Mc1r-dependent UVB response contained an abundance of genes associated with regulating the cell cycle and oncogenesis. To test the clinical relevance of these observations, we analyzed publicly available data sets for primary melanoma and melanoma metastases and found that the set of genes specific for the Mc1r-dependent UVB response was able to differentiate between different clinical subtypes. Our analysis also revealed that the classes of genes induced by UVB differ from those repressed by UVB with regard to their biological functions, their overall number, and their size. The findings described here offer new insights into the transcriptional nature of the UV response in the skin and provide a molecular framework for the underlying mechanisms by which melanocytes and the Mc1r independently mediate and afford protection against UV radiation"

7,Development of native electrophoretic techniques for the isolation and characterization of mitochondrial complexes,https://core.ac.uk/works/6107714,"In the first part of this work, the development of a novel two-dimensional native gel electrophoretic system (2-D BN/hrCNE) is described. This new system simplifies proteomics and biochemical analysis of mega protein complexes that are dissociated into the constituent complexes during 2-D electrophoresis, thereby reducing the complexity of the system considerably. This technique is exceptionally well suited for the in-gel detection of fluorescence-labeled proteins and the identification of individual enzymes and protein complexes by specific in-gel assays on native gels.

In the second part, a new technique for the native immunoblotting of blue native gels (NIBN) was developed. This new technique allows for the identification of conformation-specific antibodies and the discrimination of antibodies recognizing linear epitopes of denatured proteins. Identification of conformation-specific antibodies is becoming increasingly important not only for the electron microscopic identification of native proteins but also for structural investigations in general. For this purpose, a commonly used protocol for Western blotting of blue native gels was modified in such a way that the native state of proteins and protein complexes was retained throughout the complete protocol. Instead of using the denaturing methanol in Western blotting protocols, mild detergents such as Tween 20, digitonin and Brij 35 were used for the obligatory removal of protein bound Coomassie-dye.

The detection of respiratory complex I by activity staining on the blot membrane demonstrated that all three non-ionic detergents preserved the native state of complex I. The native state of the enzyme on the blot membrane was also monitored and confirmed with the help of a set of conformation-specific antibodies. NIBN can be used as a simple alternative method to the demanding native ELISA to screen for conformation-specific antibodies for structural studies. Unlike the time consuming native ELISA, NIBN does not require introduction of appropriate affinity tags and purification of the target protein by chromatography. Thus, the NIBN technique is especially useful for microscale projects and for proteins not easily accessible to genetic manipulation.

The third part aimed at identification of the immediate protein interaction partners of Cox26, a hydrophobic protein that has been identified by our group as a novel component of yeast respiratory supercomplex. Multi-dimensional electrophoretic techniques were applied to identify non-covalent and covalent protein-protein interactions of Cox26. Three-dimensional electrophoresis (BNE/BNE/SDS-PAGE) gave both qualitative and quantitative information on covalent and non-covalent interactions of Cox26 and subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), and showed that most of the Cox26 protein was non-covalently bound to the complex IV moiety of the respirasomes. Four-dimensional electrophoresis (BNE/BNE/SDS/SDS-PAGE) applying reducing and non-reducing conditions revealed that a minor fraction of Cox26 used a single cysteine residue in the center of a predicted transmembrane helix to form a disulfide bond with the Cox2 subunit of complex IV. A structural role of Cox26 protein in the assembly/stability of respiratory strings or patches has been suggested.

The last part of this work focused on the isolation and characterization of native and morphologically intact nucleoids from bovine heart mitochondria, since only a few studies on nucleoid organization and composition have been carried out on mammalian tissues. The nucleoids appeared as distinct bands (apparent mass around 30-36 MDa) in blue native-PAGE on large pore gels. The moderate variation in particle size seems to reflect variations in the binding of loosely nucleoid-associated components like respiratory chain complexes. The estimated 30-36 MDa mass of nucleoids on native gels suggested that each nucleoid contains one mtDNA molecule provided that nucleoids contains equal amounts of DNA, protein and RNA (Miyakawa et al., 1987).

Electron microscopic analysis of native nucleoids, which was performed by Dr. Karen Davies from the Max-Planck-Institute of Biophysics, Department of Structural Biology, Frankfurt, showed homogenous pool of particles with dimensions in 85x100 nm (in negative stain) and 100x150 nm (in cryo-tomography). Some of the nucleoids showed dumbbell-shape indicating dimerization of nucleoids. Recent EM and high-resolution light microscopy analysis of mammalian nucleoids have reported that nucleoids have a size of 70 nm in average. We also observed the same size of 70 nm in cryo-tomogramms when we applied harsher treatment of the native nucleoid particles with dimensions 100x150 nm. This observation is in agreement with published nucleoid sizes from both EM and high-resolution light microscopy, if we assume that native nucleoids have been dissociated under harsher treatment.

The protein composition of bovine heart mt-nucleoids was analyzed by a number of complementary approaches to identify low and highly abundant, easily dissociating and tightly bound proteins, and to rank the 90 most abundant mt-nucleoid proteins. Native and denaturing gel electrophoresis techniques were coupled to LC-MS/MS to achieve a comprehensive protein component analysis. Qualitative MS analysis of highly purified nucleoids identified more than 400 proteins, including well known nucleoid proteins such as mitochondrial transcription factor and mtDNA-binding protein (TFAM), mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB), mitochondrial DNA polymerase subunit gamma-2 (POLG2) and mitochondrial helicase C26H10ORF2 protein (Twinkle). These proteins were ranked according to Mascot scores, and sorted according to presumed functional properties. A large group of proteins involved in protein synthesis comprised an almost complete set of subunits of mitochondrial ribosomes suggesting that the nucleoids contained significant amounts of mitochondrial ribosomes. Identification of sixty six proteins from the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system comprising around 100 proteins in total suggested that OXPHOS proteins are also associated with mt-nucleoids.

Interestingly, TFAM, described as a main mtDNA packaging factor in human and other mammalian cells, was not confirmed here as a major nucleoid component from bovine heart mitochondria. Fluorescence staining of protein spots on 2-D IEF/SDS gels clearly identified TFAM, but according to the stain intensity, this protein did not rank in the list of the 90 most abundant nucleoid proteins. Western blot analysis of sucrose gradient fractions revealed an enrichment of putative TFAM isoform in nucleoid fractions. Unexpectedly, the uncharacterized mitochondrial protein Es1 was identified as the most abundant nucleoid protein in bovine heart nucleoids instead. This implicates that nucleoid organization may differ between species and tissues. A functional characterization of Es1 is required to clarify its role in mammalian nucleoids.Das erste Ziel dieser Arbeit war die Entwicklung eines neuen zwei-dimensionalen Elektrophoresesystems, bei dem der native Zustand von Proteinen und Proteinkomplexen in beiden aufeinanderfolgenden Laufrichtungen erhalten bleiben sollte. Damit sollte die proteinchemische und biochemische Untersuchung riesiger Proteinkomplexe, wie der Superkomplexe der mitochondrialen Atmungskette, wesentlich erleichtert werden. Gleichzeitig sollten die gravierenden Nachteile der bisher bekannten zwei-dimensionalen Blau-Nativ Elektrophorese (2-D BN/BN Elektrophorese) vermieden werden. Dieses System hat nämlich den Nachteil, dass der verwendete Coomassie-Farbstoff in der zweiten Dimension der Elektrophorese die In-Gel-Farbreaktionen und die Detektierbarkeit von Fluoreszenz-markierten Proteinen beträchtlich stört. Deswegen wurde im neuen 2-D Elektrophoresesystem (2-D BN/hrCNE) die sogenannte “high-resolution clear native electrophoresis“ (hrCNE) für die zweite Laufrichtung verwendet, die eine ungestörte Proteinidentifizierung im Gel über Fluoreszenzmarkierung und enzymatische Tests erlaubt. Diese neue Kombination zweier Nativ-Elektrophoresen (BNE und hrCNE) vereinfacht proteomische und biochemische Analysen von Superkomplexen, weil BNE zur Isolierung von Superkomplexen geeignet ist und die nachfolgende hrCNE, Einzelkomplexe aus den Superkomplexen abspaltet und voneinander trennt. Damit wird die Komplexität des Systems beträchtlich reduziert. Das System eignet sich besonders für die Identifizierung von Membranproteinkomplexen anhand spezifischer Fluoreszenzmarkierungen oder anhand ihrer enzymatischen Eigenschaften, die direkt im Nativ-Gel analysiert werden können. Verwendung fand dieser Ansatz vor allem bei der Identifizierung und Charakterisierung von Superkomplexen der mitochondrialen Atmungskette aus unterschiedlichen Spezies und Geweben. Die Analyse der obligat aeroben Hefe Yarrowia lipolytica führte zur Identifizierung bisher nicht bekannter Typen von Superkomplexen.

Ein zweites Ziel der Arbeit war die Entwicklung einer Methode für das Native Immunoblotting von Blau-Nativen Gelen (NIBN). Die neue Technik sollte die Identifizierung von konformationsspezifischen Antikörpern ermöglichen und die Unterscheidung von Antikörpern erlauben, die lineare Epitope von denaturierten Proteinen erkennen. Dies wird immer wichtiger für die elektronenmikroskopische Identifizierung von nativen Proteinen und generell für Strukturuntersuchungen. Zu diesem Zweck wurde ein allgemein verwendetes Protokoll für den Western Blott von Blau-Nativen Gelen auf solche Art und Weise modifiziert, dass der native Zustand von Proteinen und Protein-Komplexen in jedem Teilschritt des Protokolls bewahrt wurde. Anstelle des in Western Blott üblicherweise verwendeten Methanols, der leicht zur Proteindenaturierung führt, wurden milde Detergenzien wie Tween 20, Digitonin oder Brij 35 zur Entfärbung des Blotts verwendet. Als Modell für die Methodenentwicklung diente der größte und komplizierteste Atmungskettenkomplex aus Y. lipolytica, die NADH:Ubichinon Oxidoreduktase (Komplex I). Der native Zustand des Enzyms auf der Blott-Membran wurde anschließend durch Aktivitätsfärbung überprüft. Aktivitätsfärbungen des Komplex I auf der Membran, die mit milden Detergentien gewaschen wurden zeigten, dass die NADH Oxidationsdomäne des Enzymes nach Entfernung des Coomassie-Farbstoffes immer noch funktionell blieb. Dies wurde auch durch Verwendung monoklonaler Antikörper, die ausschließlich unter nativen Bedingungen an Komplex I binden, bestätigt. NIBN kann als eine einfache alternative Methode an Stelle des technisch anspruchsvollen und aufwändigen nativen ELISA verwendet werden, wenn ein Fundus von Antikörpern nach konformationsspezifischen Antikörpern für strukturelle, meist elektronenmikroskopische Studien durchsucht werden soll. Im Vergleich zur aufwändigen Probenvorbereitung beim nativen ELISA mit Affinitätschromatographie und Proteinaufreinigung, spart NIBN viel Zeit, weil keine “affinity-tags” in Proteine eingebaut werden müssen und keine Affinitätschromatograpie gebraucht wird. Die native Elektrophorese übernimmt selbst die Isolierung des interessierenden Proteins oder Proteinkomplexes. Besonders wertvoll ist die NIBN-Technik für Proben, die nicht leicht einer genetischen Manipulation und der Einführung von “affinity-tags” zugänglich sind.

Der dritte Teil der Arbeit hatte zum Ziel, die direkten Protein-Protein Kontakte von Cox26, einem hydrophoben Protein, zu ermitteln, das Schägger und Kollegen in Hefe-Superkomplexen (Respirasome) identifiziert hatten. Die Superkomplexe von S. cerevisiae, die aus den Komplexen III und IV zusammengesetzt sind, enthalten mindestens 21 Untereinheiten. Zehn Untereinheiten davon sind dem Komplex III zuzurechnen und elf Untereinheiten dem Komplex IV. All diese Untereinheiten waren zunächst als potentielle Nachbarn des Cox26 Proteins anzusehen. Um die tatsächlich vorliegenden Topologien zu ermitteln, wurden multi-dimensionale elektrophoretische Techniken angewendet, die geeignet sind kovalente und nicht-kovalente Protein-Protein Wechselwirkungen von Cox26 zu identifizieren. Drei-dimensionale Elektrophorese (BN/BN/SDS-PAGE) zeigte, dass der Hauptanteil aller Cox26 Proteine nicht-kovalent an die Komplex IV-Komponente der Respirasome gebunden war. Vier-dimensionale Elektrophorese (BN/BN/SDS/SDS-PAGE) unter reduzierenden und nicht-reduzierenden Bedingungen zeigte, dass ein geringer Anteil der Cox26 Proteine an einen Cysteinrest der Cox2-Untereinheit des Komplex IV unter Ausbildung einer Disulfid-Brücke gebunden war. Dies legte nahe, dass Cox26 eine spezielle Rolle für den Komplex IV spielt, obwohl bisher keine konkrete Funktion nachgewiesen werden konnte und bei Cox26-Defizienz kein spezieller Phänotyp auftritt. Auf der Grundlage eines Strukturmodells des Hefe-Respirasoms und mit der neuen Erkenntnis, dass eine Disulfid-Brücke zwischen Cox2 und Cox 26 existiert, wurde eine strukturelle Rolle des Cox26 Proteins für die Assemblierung und/oder Stabilität von respiratorischen Ketten oder Netzen vorgeschlagen.

Der vierte Abschnitt dieser Arbeit hatte die Isolierung und Charakterisierung von nativen und morphologisch intakten Nucleoiden aus Rinderherzmitochondrien zum Ziel. Mitochondrien besitzen eine eigene mitochondriale DNA (mtDNA), die im Matrixraum lokalisiert ist. .."

9,Effects of Long-Term Pioglitazone Treatment on Peripheral and Central Markers of Aging,https://core.ac.uk/works/69227987,"BACKGROUND: Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and are used clinically to help restore peripheral insulin sensitivity in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Interestingly, long-term treatment of mouse models of Alzheimer\u27s disease (AD) with TZDs also has been shown to reduce several well-established brain biomarkers of AD including inflammation, oxidative stress and Abeta accumulation. While TZD\u27s actions in AD models help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying their potentially beneficial effects in AD patients, little is known about the functional consequences of TZDs in animal models of normal aging. Because aging is a common risk factor for both AD and T2DM, we investigated whether the TZD, pioglitazone could alter brain aging under non-pathological conditions.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used the F344 rat model of aging, and monitored behavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular variables to assess the effects of pioglitazone (PIO-Actos® a TZD) on several peripheral (blood and liver) and central (hippocampal) biomarkers of aging. Starting at 3 months or 17 months of age, male rats were treated for 4-5 months with either a control or a PIO-containing diet (final dose approximately 2.3 mg/kg body weight/day). A significant reduction in the Ca2+-dependent afterhyperpolarization was seen in the aged animals, with no significant change in long-term potentiation maintenance or learning and memory performance. Blood insulin levels were unchanged with age, but significantly reduced by PIO. Finally, a combination of microarray analyses on hippocampal tissue and serum-based multiplex cytokine assays revealed that age-dependent inflammatory increases were not reversed by PIO.
CONCLUSIONS: While current research efforts continue to identify the underlying processes responsible for the progressive decline in cognitive function seen during normal aging, available medical treatments are still very limited. Because TZDs have been shown to have benefits in age-related conditions such as T2DM and AD, our study was aimed at elucidating PIO\u27s potentially beneficial actions in normal aging. Using a clinically-relevant dose and delivery method, long-term PIO treatment was able to blunt several indices of aging but apparently affected neither age-related cognitive decline nor peripheral/central age-related increases in inflammatory signaling"
0,Substrate Identification of an Oncogenic Kinase: Elucidating the Pathogenesis of a Rare Liver Cancer,https://core.ac.uk/works/69455545,"Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer with limited treatment options. This cancer primarily affects adolescents and young adults. Our lab has identified a new fusion gene in this cancer called DNAJB1-PRKACA that results from a break and re-fusion in chromosome 19. This chimeric gene results in a fusion kinase that acts as the driver of this cancer. While we have shown that the kinase activity of the fusion protein is essential for transformation, it is not currently known whether the oncogenic kinase that results from this fusion event, DNAJB1- PRKACA, phosphorylates the same substrates as PRKACA, the protein product of PRKACA. While the total phosphoproteome of a cancer can implicate critical pathway changes in the tumor versus healthy tissue, it cannot provide sufficient information on what kinase is directly responsible for the phosphorylations. Knowing which proteins DNAJB1-PRKACA is directly phosphorylating in the liver could help elucidate a stepwise mechanism for understanding the pathogenesis. Furthermore, it could provide new potential therapeutic options by targeting the downstream pathways of this oncogenic kinase. In this thesis, I will first describe my work to determine a method of directly identifying proteins that are substrates of DNAJB1-PRKACA and PRKACA. I first tested an approach developed by the Shokat Lab that uses an analog-sensitive (AS) kinase in combination with a selective adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analog to identify unique substrates of a kinase. However, serious concerns of substrate specificity of the AS-kinases were raised as I developed AS versions of DNAJB1-PRKACA and PRKACA. I pivoted to a method that kills the endogenous kinase activity of a lysate using 5’-(4-Fluorosulfonylbenzoyl)adenosine (FSBA); kinase reactions are performed using this kinase-inactive lysate with the purified active kinase of interest and an ATP analog that has a tag on the γ-phosphate. This results in substrates with a specific thiol tag. The ATP-γ-S analog I initially used for this method was effective in visualizing kinase activity changes via western blots, but the thiol-tags were not reliably identified using MS. With the improvement of phosphopeptide enrichment methods and encouragement from the Proteomics Resource Center, a pilot experiment was designed to enrich phosphopeptides from a kinase reaction using regular ATP, FSBAtreated mouse liver lysate, and either PRKACA or DNAJB1-PRKACA. The results of this pilot experiment showed promising differences in substrate specificity between PRKACA and DNAJB1-PRKACA so I moved forward with this assay using human hepatocyte lysate instead of mouse liver lysate. In the third chapter, I will discuss the results of the assay using kinase-inactive human hepatocyte lysate in kinase reactions to determine substrate differences between three kinases: DNAJB1-PRKACA, PRKACA, and PRKACA (L206R). PRKACA (L206R) is a PRKACA variant found in adrenal tumors of patients with Cushing’s disease. The L206R mutation is thought to block interaction with the regulatory subunit and pathogenesis of the adrenal tumors has been accepted to be the result of constitutive activity of this mutant catalytic subunit. Recently, two papers have suggested that there is an alteration in substrate specificity between PRKACA and PRKACA (L206R). My results demonstrate that there are differences in substrates that are directly phosphorylated by each of the three catalytic subunits: PRKACA, JPRKACA, and PRKACA (L206R). Finally, I will discuss how the results of a total phosphome study of FLC patient tumor and normal samples compared against my in vitro substrate identification assay. This comparison created a more patient-relevant and focused list of direct substrates of DNAJB1-PRKACA for further study. The thesis will conclude with discussion of the implications for the pathogenesis of FLC based on the direct substrates of interest found in these experiments and future experiments"
1,Myelin Proteomics: Molecular Anatomy of an Insulating Sheath,https://core.ac.uk/works/3741650,"Fast-transmitting vertebrate axons are electrically insulated with multiple layers of nonconductive plasma membrane of glial cell origin, termed myelin. The myelin membrane is dominated by lipids, and its protein composition has historically been viewed to be of very low complexity. In this review, we discuss an updated reference compendium of 342 proteins associated with central nervous system myelin that represents a valuable resource for analyzing myelin biogenesis and white matter homeostasis. Cataloging the myelin proteome has been made possible by technical advances in the separation and mass spectrometric detection of proteins, also referred to as proteomics. This led to the identification of a large number of novel myelin-associated proteins, many of which represent low abundant components involved in catalytic activities, the cytoskeleton, vesicular trafficking, or cell adhesion. By mass spectrometry-based quantification, proteolipid protein and myelin basic protein constitute 17% and 8% of total myelin protein, respectively, suggesting that their abundance was previously overestimated. As the biochemical profile of myelin-associated proteins is highly reproducible, differential proteome analyses can be applied to material isolated from patients or animal models of myelin-related diseases such as multiple sclerosis and leukodystrophies"
2,Self-beliefs in the introductory programming lab and game-based fantasy role-play,https://core.ac.uk/works/7986805,"This thesis was submitted for the degree of Doctor of philosophy and awarded by Brunel University LondonIt is important for students to engage in adequate deliberate practice in order to develop programming expertise. However, students often encounter anxiety when they begin to learn. This can present a challenge to educators because such anxiety can influence practice behaviour. This thesis situates this challenge within the Control- Value Theory of Achievement Emotions, emphasising a need for domain-specific research and presenting new research tools which can be used to investigate the area. Analysis of data collected from three
cohorts of introductory programming students on web programming (2011-12) and robot programming (2012-13 and 2013-14) courses show that programming self-concept and programming aptitude mindset can predict programming anxiety and that programming anxiety is negatively correlated with programming practice. However, levels of anxiety remained consistently high across this period. A method to enrich these psychological constructs through a multimedia-rich learning environment is proposed. Drawing upon the interplay between narrative reinforcement and procedural rhetoric that can be achieved in a fantasy role-play, students' self-concept can be enhanced. A double-blind randomised controlled trial demonstrates promising
results, however small effect sizes suggest further research is needed"
3,PAX8 in ovarian carcinoma: identification of new downstream networks and target genes,https://core.ac.uk/works/87527332,"PAX8 is a transcription factor involved in the tissue-specific expression of several genes during development, tissue homeostasis and cancer. Recently, PAX8 has been reported to be an important marker for the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma with a pivotal function in the tumorigenic phenotype of ovarian cancer cells. PAX8 is normally expressed in Fallopian tube secretory cells but not in ovarian surface epithelial cells; however, its expression is detected in the majority of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) supporting the tubal origin of this cancer. To determine whether PAX8 contributes to ovarian cancer development, we initially conducted a transcriptome analyses to determine the distinctive molecular profiles of the Fallopian tube epithelial secretory cell line (FT194) and the ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV3), before and after PAX8 silencing. The bioinformatics analysis revealed several GO categories enriched in both PAX8-silenced FT-194 and SKOV3 cells. Among those categories, the results showed that both “cell migration” and the “positive regulation of cell migration” bioprocess displayed transcriptional change of 5% in SKOV3 cells and the adhesion category shows change of about 16% in SKOV3 and 14% in FT-194 cells. With respect to specific pathways, the highest differential changes upon PAX8 silencing were found in angiogenesis, Wnt, cadherin and integrin signalling pathways, in both cell types.
Since migration and adhesion are important biological processes in both physiological and pathological conditions, migration and adhesion assays were performed using a primary human fallopian tube secretory cells (Primary hFTSECs) and a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3, KURAMOCHI, OVSAHO and PEA1). Interestingly, our results show that inhibition of PAX8 expression in Primary hFTSEC and in epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines significantly reduces the ability of the cells to migrate and adhere on Fibronectin and/or Collagen I substrates.
Integrins are reported to be the major regulators of cellular attachment with the extracellular matrix and are required for cellular migration. In our transcriptome analysis, Integrin β3 was significantly downregulated after PAX8 silencing in SKOV3 cells. Therefore, we performed qRT-PCR on Primary hFTSEC and our panel of ovarian cancer cell lines and the results show a strong reduction of Integrin β3 expression in all ovarian cancer cell lines after PAX8 silencing, respect to the control cells. In parallel, we also show that loss of PAX8 does not affect the expression of Integrin αv, the ligand of Integrin β3 involved in ovarian cancer tumorigenesis. The Immunofluorescences assays of the functional heterodimer αvβ3 was tested in Primary hFTSEC and KURAMOCHI cell lines and in PAX8 silenced cells the signal was decreased. In conclusion, we believe that it is of great relevance to further study and decipher the link between PAX8 and Integrin β3 because it could help uncover the role of PAX8 in HGSC development"

5,Investigation into the effect of LRRK2-Rab10 protein interactions on the Proboscis Extension Response of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,https://core.ac.uk/works/8607359,"Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a debilitating disease which affects 1% of the population worldwide and

is characterised by stiffness, tremor and bradykinesia. PD is a complex disease with many suspected

genetic and environmental causes, and it is critical to understand all the pathways involved in

disease progression to develop effective therapies for PD, which currently has no cure. A kinasecoding gene, LRRK2 has emerged as a focal point for much PD research, particularly PD-associated

SNP LRRK2-G2019S, which leads to LRRK2 overactivity. Rab proteins, a series of small GTPases, have

been identified among the proteins phosphorylated by LRRK2. These interactions may be modelled

in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.

Using optogenetics in the fly, this project investigates the relationship between the LRRK2-G2019S

and Rab10 interaction, and the speed and degree of tremor of Proboscis Extension Response (PER)

by triggering a PER in fly lines of different genotypes. Significant bradykinesia in Rab10 null flies

which was not recreated in flies with dopaminergic neuron Rab10RNAi suggests that the bradykinesia

PER phenotype is caused by off-target effect of Rab10-KO in another tissue of the fly than the

dopaminergic neurons. Over-expression of Rab10 in dopaminergic neurons of flies also expressing

LRRK2-G2019S produced resting tremor and inability to fully extend the proboscis"
6,Whsc1l1 Regulates Estrogen Receptor Activity In Sum44 Breast Cancer Cells,https://core.ac.uk/works/31608791,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading
cause of cancer death in women. While ER-positive breast cancer subtypes are initially
well-managed by targeted therapies targeting estrogen signaling, many women are
suffering from recurrence of a more aggressive, hormone insensitive cancer 5 or more years after initial remission. Late recurrence of hormone resistant breast cancer in patients
who were previously successfully treated with anti-estrogen therapies worsens
overall long-term outcomes, and specific oncogenic mutations may be driving late recurring aggressive disease in these patients. More complete characterization of the oncogenome of
a tumor may allow for the possibility of customized therapy targeting each patient\u27s
specific oncogene-activating mutations, and in doing so increase the probability
of durable remission over the long term. Basic research on cell lines modeling
different breast cancer subtypes makes possible discovery and characterization of novel
driving oncogenes and their context in a breast cancer subtype model.
The Wolf Hirschhorn Syndrome Candidate 1-Like 1 gene (WHSC1L1) is one of
approximately 50 genes in the chromosome 8p11-p12 amplicon, an amplified region
of the short arm of chromosome 8 found in 12-15% of human breast cancers, as well
as other cancer types such as lung. Amplification of the 8p11-p12 region is
most often found in breast cancers of the luminal B subtype. WHSC1L1 is a member of the NSD family of histone lysine methyltransferases, SET domain-containing proteins which
catalyze the addition of a methyl group to lysines on the amino-terminal tail
of histone H3 subunits. The WHSC1L1 gene expresses two known isoforms which code for two distinct proteins, WHSC1L1-long and WHSC1L1-short. The short isoform of WHSC1L1 codes for the first 647 of the 1437 amino acids present in the long isoform, and lacks the catalytic SET
domain and several PHD and PWWP chromatin interacting domains, containing a single
PWWP domain and a recently characterized acidic transactivation domain. In both
normal and tumor breast tissue, WHSC1L1-short is expressed at greater levels
than WHSC1L1-long. Several breast cancer cell lines established in the Ethier
lab harbor WHSC1L1 amplifications and also overexpress both isoforms of WHSC1L1.
The SUM44 cell line is a highly ER-positive cell line model of luminal B breast cancer isolated from a pleural effusion metastasis of a patient with aggressive disease. It is known that the
short isoform of WHSC1L1, WHSC1L1-short, is a potent driving oncogene in SUM44
cells, however the specific mechanism of WHSC1L1-short as an oncomodifier is not known.
To investigate WHSC1L1-short function as an oncogene in
SUM44 cells, we developed an shRNA knockdown model that specifically knocked down
expression of WHSC1L1-short through its unique 3\u27 UTR sequence (shWHSC1L1-short), and a model that knocked down both WHSC1L1 isoforms (shWHSC1L1-total). We found that knockdown of both total WHSC1L1 and WHSC1L1-short alone negatively affected SUM44 proliferation, and that WHSC1L1-short knockdown had a larger effect than knockdown of both isoforms. After finding that WHSC1L1 expression was required for typical proliferation rates of SUM44 cells, we performed genome-wide expression profiling of SUM44 WHSC1L1-short and total WHSC1L1 knockdown cell lines relative to a control SUM44 line transduced with shRNA against lacZ. Again we found that knockdown of the WHSC1L1-short alone had a greater affect than total WHSC1L1 knockdown, this time on the number of significantly differentially expressed genes;
1131 genes were found to be differentially expressed in the WHSC1L1-short knockdown
cells relative to shLacZ control, while 238 genes were differentially expressed
in the total WHSC1L1 knockdown SUM44 cells relative to shLacZ control. Interestingly,
the ESR1 gene, which codes for the estrogen receptor alpha protein, was significantly
downregulated by WHSC1L1-short knockdown. This was confirmed by immunoblotting
with ERa antibody. While total WHSC1L1 knockdown also had a negative
effect on ERa protein levels in SUM44, knockdown of WHSC1L1-short alone
almost completely abrogated ERa in SUM44 as measured by western blot.
We subsequently found that SUM44 cells were extremely sensitive to treatment
with beta-estradiol, and that proliferation actually decreased upon as little
as 100 picomolar beta-estradiol treatment, with dose-dependent decreases in
proliferation as estrogen concentrations increased. We also found SUM44 cells to be
relatively insensitive to Tamoxifen. Knockdown of WHSC1L1-short reduced proliferation
of SUM44 cells in estrogen-free conditions, and treatment of SUM44 shWHSC1L1-short
cells with increasing concentrations of beta-estradiol resulted in a marginal increase in proliferation up to 100pM beta-estradiol, then proliferation decreased with increasing beta-estradiol concentrations similar to results seen in SUM44 shLacZ control cells.
After observing that WHSC1L1-short overexpression was required for expression
of ERa in SUM44 cells, we asked whether knockdown of WHSC1L1-short
affected genome-wide binding patterns of the estrogen receptor in SUM44 cells.
Interestingly we found that ERa was binding to thousands of genomic
loci in the absence of exogenous estrogen. Treatment with high doses (10nM) of beta-estradiol for 45 minutes resulted in an approximately even increase in ERa binding
across sites already bound in the absence of estrogen, with some additional weak
binding sites, but no significant changes in the pattern of ERa binding.
No ERa binding sites were detected in SUM44 shWHSC1L1-short cells under
estrogen-free conditions, and weak ERa binding was detected in SUM44
shWHSC1L1-short cells treated with 10nM beta-estradiol at loci where strong
ERa binding was observed in control SUM44 cells, suggesting that
WHSC1L1-short knockdown was reducing ERa expression levels, which
made less ERa available to bind to chromatin in SUM44 shWHSC1L1-short
cells.
Our investigation of WHSC1L1 oncogenic activity in SUM44 cells resulted in
the interesting observation that the short isoform of WHSC1L1 is required for
expression of the estrogen receptor alpha in these cells, and that ERa
is bound extensively to chromatin without activation of ERa by estrogen.
SUM44 is a model for luminal B breast cancer, and is highly ER-positive, and
expresses little to no progesterone receptor (PR). While the implications of
ERa expression dependence on WHSC1L1-short overexpression in SUM44
cells are not yet clear, the extensive binding of ERa to estrogen
response elements (ERE\u27s) in the absence of exogenous estrogen and the
negative proliferative response of SUM44 to estrogen indicate that WHSC1L1 amplification
and overexpression may alter the biology of the estrogen receptor in breast cancers
harboring WHSC1L1 amplification and overexpression.
Additionally, the differences seen in ERa binding to chromatin and
the negative response of SUM44 cells to ERa agonists illustrate the
importance of researching ER-positive breast cancer using additional cell line
models rather than consistently using MCF7 cells to represent ER-positive disease.
The dominant role of the catalytically-inactive short isoform of WHSC1L1 in regulating
ERa expression and maintaining the proliferation rate of SUM44 cells
suggests that catalytically inactive isoforms of chromatin modifying enzymes
can be important regulators of gene expression. Interestingly, recent work
has shown that WHSC1L1-short is likely not regulating target gene expression
through histone methylation, but instead is acting as a co-factor for a different
chromatin-binding complex, the BRD4-CHD8 complex, which has been shown to be
recruited to superenhancer regions (marked by histone acetylation) by WHSC1L1-short,
which results in activation of pTEFb through BRD4 and directly activates target
gene transcription. It will be important to avoid assumptions about binding substrate
identities of catalytically inactive isoforms of future chromatin modifiers of interest, as
the catalytically inactive isoforms of these genes may also bind to chromatin substrates unrelated to the substrate of the catalytically
active isoform"
7,Rab GTPases as mediators of neuronal robustness in Drosophila,https://core.ac.uk/works/44169346,"One common feature of all eukaryotic cells is the presence of various specialized organelles,
separated by membranes, which necessitates a coordinated trafficking of materials between
these subcellular membrane-bound compartments. Especially neurons, with their long
lifespan, polarized and often complex morphology, as well as their specialized functions,
have particular requirements for membrane trafficking. Not surprisingly, membrane
trafficking is involved in all aspects of neuronal development, function, and long-term
maintenance. The evolutionary conserved family of small Rab GTPases functions as key
regulator of coordinated vesicular trafficking in the endomembrane system. Expression
profiling efforts revealed that in Drosophila half of all Rab GTPases are enriched in or
specific to the nervous system, in humans it is one-third. However, the exact functions of the
majority of nervous system-enriched Rab proteins are still unknown. Thus, studying the
individual roles of those Rab GTPases more closely provides a great opportunity to gain
more insight into the membrane trafficking networks in neurons. Ultimately, this will surely
contribute to the understanding of what keeps neurons and in particular synapses healthy and functional over extended periods of time. In the nervous system, Rab GTPases and the
membrane trafficking events these mediate have been widely associated with many
neurodegenerative diseases. However, the established relations are often more correlatively
than causatively linked, as discussed in Manuscript 1.
Regarding the importance of an intact intracellular trafficking machinery for the
development as well as neuronal function and maintenance, I primarily focused on the
systematic functional analysis of nervous system-enriched Rab GTPases in Drosophila
during my doctoral work. Previously, no systematic rab mutant characterization in any
multicellular organism had been performed. The analysis, presented in Manuscript 2,
revealed that the homozygous mutants of all nervous system-enriched Rab GTPases, raised
under laboratory conditions, are viable and fertile, whereas, null mutants of ubiquitously
expressed Rabs are all lethal under homozygosity. Thus, suggesting that Rab proteins, with
high expression in the nervous system, serve more modulatory, specialized functions which
are not essential for the survival of the organism. Further, we could show that all viable rab
mutants differentially affect the development or neuronal function under variable, more
challenging environmental conditions, such as temperature and light. This highlights the
evolved robustness of developmental processes and nervous system function towards
varying conditions. Additionally, during the in-depth functional analysis of nervous system-enriched Rab26, we revealed a stimulus-dependent role in the trafficking of the single
acetylcholine receptor subunit Dα4 at cholinergic synapses of outer photoreceptors.
However, we could not verify a role for Rab26 in the autophagic turnover of synaptic
vesicles in neurons.
Additional assays, such as the RUSH system, can be useful to support functional
analyses. While this acute, synchronous release system could be established for Rabs in
developing photoreceptors and salivary glands, wing imaginal discs proofed to be more
sensitive and no working conditions could be established. Using the RUSH assay, different
release dynamics with ‘fast’ as well as ‘slow’ releasing Rab GTPases could be identified as
shown in Manuscript 3. Further, two nervous system-enriched Rab proteins, namely Rab23
and Rab26, show a clear re-localization from the cell body to the axon terminals, which is
in agreement with their predominant synaptic neuropil localization revealed by expression
profiling.
In conclusion, the findings made during my doctoral work will contribute to a better
understanding of the functional requirements of neurons regarding Rab-mediated membrane trafficking. The complete rab null mutant collection as well as the RUSH and LAMA transgenic toolbox provide a strong basis for further investigations of individual Rab
functions during development and homeostasis"
8,The oncogene AAMDC links PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling with metabolic reprograming in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer,https://core.ac.uk/works/112939878,"Adipogenesis associated Mth938 domain containing (AAMDC) represents an uncharacterized oncogene amplified in aggressive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers. We uncover that AAMDC regulates the expression of several metabolic enzymes involved in the one-carbon folate and methionine cycles, and lipid metabolism. We show that AAMDC controls PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, regulating the translation of ATF4 and MYC and modulating the transcriptional activity of AAMDC-dependent promoters. High AAMDC expression is associated with sensitization to dactolisib and everolimus, and these PI3K-mTOR inhibitors exhibit synergistic interactions with anti-estrogens in IntClust2 models. Ectopic AAMDC expression is sufficient to activate AKT signaling, resulting in estrogen-independent tumor growth. Thus, AAMDC-overexpressing tumors may be sensitive to PI3K-mTORC1 blockers in combination with anti-estrogens. Lastly, we provide evidence that AAMDC can interact with the RabGTPase-activating protein RabGAP1L, and that AAMDC, RabGAP1L, and Rab7a colocalize in endolysosomes. The discovery of the RabGAP1L-AAMDC assembly platform provides insights for the design of selective blockers to target malignancies having the AAMDC amplification"
9,Emulation of Industrial Control Field Device Protocols,https://core.ac.uk/works/77340580,"It has been shown that thousands of industrial control devices are exposed to the Internet, however, the extent and nature of attacks on such devices remains unknown. The first step to understanding security problems that face modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and industrial controls networks is to understand the various attacks launched on Internet-connected field devices. This thesis describes the design and implementation of an industrial control emulator on a Gumstix single-board computer as a solution. This emulator acts as a decoy field device, or honeypot, intended to be probed and attacked via an Internet connection. Evaluation techniques are developed to assess the accuracy of the emulation implemented on the Gumstix and are compared against the implementation on a standard PC and the emulation target, a Koyo DirectLogic 405 programmable logic controller. The results show that both the Gumstix and PC emulator platforms are very accurate to the workloads presented.

This effort has led to the implication of LRRK2 in a bewildering range of cell biological processes and pathways, and probable roles in a number of seemingly unrelated medical conditions. In this review we summarise current knowledge of the basic biochemistry and cellular function of LRRK2. Topics covered include the identification of phosphorylation substrates of LRRK2 kinase activity, in particular Rab proteins, and advances in understanding the activation of LRRK2 kinase activity via dimerisation and association with membranes, especially via interaction with Rab29. We also discuss biochemical studies that shed light on the complex LRRK2 GTPase activity, evidence of roles for LRRK2 in a range of cell signalling pathways that are likely cell type specific, and studies linking LRRK2 to the cell biology of organelles. The latter includes the involvement of LRRK2 in autophagy, endocytosis, and processes at the trans-Golgi network, the endoplasmic reticulum and also key microtubule-based cellular structures. We further propose a mechanism linking LRRK2 dimerisation, GTPase function and membrane recruitment with LRRK2 kinase activation by Rab29. Together these data paint a picture of a research field that in many ways is moving forward with great momentum, but in other ways has not changed fundamentally. Many key advances have been made, but very often they seem to lead back to the same places"
1,Regulation of constitutive platelet-derived growth factor receptor degradation by the 105 kilodalton isoform of ankyrin3,https://core.ac.uk/works/66039156,"Deregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling is a driving event in glioblastoma, promotes tumor progression epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in multiple cancers, modulates the tumor stroma to facilitate tumorigenesis and reduces tumor uptake of chemotherapeutics. Previous studies identified the 105 kDa isoform of ankyrin3 (Ank105) as a binding partner of the PDGFR signaling machinery and demonstrated that expression of Ank105 promoted PDGFR degradation (Ignatiuk et al., 2006)(Ignatiuk et al., 2006)(Ignatiuk et al., 2006). Receptor tyrosine kinases are targeted for degradation via endocytosis and ubiquitin-dependent trafficking to the lysosome. It was hypothesized that Ank105 promoted the constitutive degradation of the PDGFR and attenuation of PDGFR signaling by facilitating endocytosis of the PDGFR and targeting the PDGFR for lysosomal degradation via an ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. The studies in this thesis characterized the effects of Ank105 expression on PDGFR signaling and protein expression levels, determined the endocytic pathways involved in Ank105-mediated PDGFR degradation and studied the role of ubiquitin binding in Ank105 function. The most robust effect of Ank105 expression on the PDGFR was constitutive degradation as PDGFR protein expression levels in Ank105-expressing cells were significantly reduced compared to NIH 3T3 cells in the absence of PDGF ligand. Low constitutive PDGFR levels resulted in attenuated pro-proliferative AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in response to ligand stimulation. To determine the endocytic requirements for Ank105-mediated constitutive PDGFR degradation, a constitutive PDGFR degradation assay was developed and the effects of several small molecule endocytosis inhibitors were evaluated. Additionally, the small molecule endocytosis inhibitors were validated by determining the effects of these inhibitors on low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake and ligand-induced PDGFR degradation in Ank105-expressing cells. Both LDL uptake and ligand induced PDGFR degradation are known to proceed by a clathrin and dynamin dependent mechanism of endocytosis. In Ank105-expressing cells, both LDL uptake and ligand incuded PDGFR degradation were dependent upon clathrin and dynamin function. Interestingly, constitutive PDGFR degradation in Ank105-expressing cells was not dependent upon CME, but required dynamin activity. Expression of Ank105 may promote clathrin-independent, dynamin-dependent, constitutive endocytosis of the PDGFR. Additionally, acute inhibition of either lysosomal or proteasomal degradation strongly impaired constitutive PDGFR degradation, whereas ligand-induced PDGFR degradation was less sensitive to protein degradation inhibitors, while LDL uptake was unaffected. It was unclear if PDGFR was degraded in the proteasome or if the proteasome was involved in sorting of PDGFR to the lysosome for degradation. Ubiquitination of receptors is required to target them for degradation. Ank105 was assayed for the ability to interact with ubiquitin and ubiquitinated proteins. Interestingly, Ank105 bound ubiquitin in vitro via the spectrin binding domain and co-immunoprecipitated with several ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting a role for Ank105 in the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins for degradation. Furthermore, Ank105 co-immunoprecipitated with a number of high and low molecular weight proteins in the absence of PDGF stimulation. Identification of Ank105 binding partners would provide further insight in the mechanism of Ank105-mediated constitutive PDGFR degradation. In summary, Ank105 promoted the attenuation of PDGFR signaling via alteration of constitutive PDGFR endocytosis and targeting of constitutive PDGFR for degradation, potentially through interaction with ubiquitin and ubiquitinated proteins. Reduction of constitutive PDGFR levels in cancers with PDGFR driver mutations, acquired PDGF responsiveness and stromal expression of PDGFR, could significantly reduce tumor proliferation, tumorigenesis and increase effectiveness of chemotherapeutics"
2,Frameshift Antigens for Cancer Vaccine Development,https://core.ac.uk/works/51404331,"abstract: Immunotherapy has been revitalized with the advent of immune checkpoint blockade

treatments, and neo-antigens are the targets of immune system in cancer patients who

respond to the treatments. The cancer vaccine field is focused on using neo-antigens from

unique point mutations of genomic sequence in the cancer patient for making

personalized cancer vaccines. However, we choose a different path to find frameshift

neo-antigens at the mRNA level and develop broadly effective cancer vaccines based on

frameshift antigens.

In this dissertation, I have summarized and characterized all the potential frameshift

antigens from microsatellite regions in human, dog and mouse. A list of frameshift

antigens was validated by PCR in tumor samples and the mutation rate was calculated for

one candidate – SEC62. I develop a method to screen the antibody response against

frameshift antigens in human and dog cancer patients by using frameshift peptide arrays.

Frameshift antigens selected by positive antibody response in cancer patients or by MHC

predictions show protection in different mouse tumor models. A dog version of the

cancer vaccine based on frameshift antigens was developed and tested in a small safety

trial. The results demonstrate that the vaccine is safe and it can induce strong B and T cell

immune responses. Further, I built the human exon junction frameshift database which

includes all possible frameshift antigens from mis-splicing events in exon junctions, and I

develop a method to find potential frameshift antigens from large cancer

immunosignature dataset with these databases. In addition, I test the idea of ‘early cancer

diagnosis, early treatment’ in a transgenic mouse cancer model. The results show that

ii

early treatment gives significantly better protection than late treatment and the correct

time point for treatment is crucial to give the best clinical benefit. A model for early

treatment is developed with these results.

Frameshift neo-antigens from microsatellite regions and mis-splicing events are

abundant at mRNA level and they are better antigens than neo-antigens from point

mutations in the genomic sequences of cancer patients in terms of high immunogenicity,

low probability to cause autoimmune diseases and low cost to develop a broadly effective

vaccine. This dissertation demonstrates the feasibility of using frameshift antigens for

cancer vaccine development.Dissertation/ThesisDoctoral Dissertation Molecular and Cellular Biology 201"
3,"Role of proline rich 15 in trophoblast cell development, The",https://core.ac.uk/works/99627655,"2012 Summer.Includes bibliographical references.Maintenance of pregnancy in eutherian mammals requires a sophisticated and tightly regulated program of gene expression in order to develop a fully functional placenta. This transient organ mediates nutrient and gas exchange between the mother and fetus while protecting the fetus from the maternal immune system. Deviations from the normal regulation of gene expression during early pregnancy can lead to early embryonic loss as well as dysfunctional placentation, which can cause significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Proline rich 15 (PRR15) is a low molecular weight nuclear protein expressed by the trophoblast during early gestation in several mammalian species, including humans, mice, cattle, sheep, and horses. Immunohistochemistry revealed localization of PRR15 to the trophectoderm and extraembryonic endoderm of day 15 sheep conceptuses. In humans, PRR15 is localized in the nuclei of both first and second trimester trophoblast cells. Additional research has shown increased PRR15 transcription in colorectal cancers with mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) protein, suggesting a link to the Wnt signaling pathway. PRR15 mRNA concentrations increase when trophoblast cells, both sheep (oTR) and human (ACH-3P), are cultured on Matrigel, a basement membrane matrix. The expression profile in the sheep conceptus during pregnancy revealed a rise in PRR15 mRNA concentrations during the period of conceptus elongation with a peak in expression at day 16 of gestation, followed by a decline to day 30 of gestation. This peak coincides with a halt in elongation of the conceptus, and the initial period of apposition to the uterine luminal epithelium. Lentiviral-mediated knockdown of PRR15 in ovine trophectoderm at the blastocyst stage led to demise of the embryo by day 15 of gestation. This provides compelling evidence that PRR15 is a critical factor during this precarious window of development when initial attachment and implantation begin.  The first aim of this research was to determine the effect of PRR15 deficiency on trophoblast gene expression, as well as trophoblast proliferation and survival. The human first trimester trophoblast cell line, ACH-3P, was infected with control lentivirus (LL3.7) and lentivirus expressing a short hairpin (sh)RNA to target PRR15 mRNA for degradation, resulting in a 68% decrease in PRR15 mRNA (p<0.01). Microarray analysis of these cell lines revealed differential expression of genes related to cancer, focal adhesion, and p53 signaling. We selected 21 genes for validation of mRNA levels by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, 18 (86%) of which gave results consistent with the microarray analysis, with similar direction and magnitude fold changes. This included significant up-regulation of GDF15, a cytokine increased in pregnancies with preeclampsia. GDF15 mRNA concentrations were examined more extensively during early ovine gestation, which revealed that GDF15 was low during peak PRR15 expression, then increased significantly at day 30 when PRR15 was nearly undetectable. Proliferation, as measured by cell metabolic activity and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake, decreased in the PRR15-deficient cells, which was consistent with a decrease observed in cell cycle-related genes CCND1 and CDK6, and an increase in CCNG2 and CDKN1A in the PRR15-deficient cells. TNFSF10, a tumor necrosis factor superfamily member known to induce apoptosis, and its receptor, TNFRSF10b, increased significantly in the PRR15-deficient cells, suggesting trophoblast cells may be more susceptible to apoptosis when depleted of PRR15. Assays for caspase activity and annexin V staining revealed an increased population of apoptotic cells when treated with shRNA to target PRR15. These results suggest that PRR15 is required for driving trophoblast proliferation and survival during early development of the placenta, functions that are critical to early embryonic survival and successful placentation.  The second experimental aim was to examine regions of the PRR15 promoter that are necessary for regulating its expression in trophoblast cells and to identify the role of Wnt signaling in PRR15 transcription. The 5'-flanking sequences from -824, -640, -424, -326, and -284 bp to +7 bp relative to the annotated transcription start site were amplified by PCR and ligated into the pGL3-Basic plasmid. These vectors were co-transfected into the first trimester human trophoblast cell line, ACH-3P, HT29 (human colorectal carcinoma), oTR, and BHK-21 (hamster kidney fibroblast) cells with a RSV-β-galactosidase vector control. In ACH-3P cells, transactivation of the luciferase reporter was maximal following transfections with the -326 construct (15.4 ± 4.8-fold). Significant promoter activity was absent in the -284, -424, and -640 constructs, but regained with the -824 construct (14.8 ± 5.8-fold). These results suggest that cis-acting elements within the proximal promoter of the PRR15 gene are essential for expression in trophoblast cells, requiring the regions from -284 to -326 and -640 to -824. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to identify transcription factor binding sites within these regions. Due to the potential link to the Wnt signaling pathway, cells were treated with an inhibitor to GSK3β, the kinase responsible for phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. Inhibition of GSK3β decreased PRR15 mRNA concentrations and decreased transactivation of the luciferase reporter in all proximal promoter reporter constructs; this effect was mediated through β-catenin activity in the proximal 284 bases of the PRR15 5'-flanking region. Furthermore, trophoblast cell proliferation decreased after treatment with the GSK3β inhibitor. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays on the region from -98 to -68 revealed differential binding of nuclear proteins derived from ACH-3P cells grown in the presence or absence of the GSK3β inhibitor. These results reveal that canonical Wnt signaling inhibits the transcription of PRR15, mediated in part through the -98 to -68 region of the 5'-flanking region, and decreases proliferation in trophoblast cells. This indicates that suppression of Wnt signaling may be crucial during early trophectoderm outgrowth in order to allow significant transcriptional activation of PRR15 and conceptus survival"
4,A relevância da sinalização da insulina na doença de Alzheimer,https://core.ac.uk/works/11569974,"Mestrado em Biologia Molecular e CelularAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia worldwide. It is molecularly characterized by deposition of extracellular senile plaques (SPs) composed by aggregated amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) derived from hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau, synaptic dysfunction due to the deposits of SPs and NFTs and oxidative stress induced by impaired metabolic pathways.
The insulin signalling pathway can play a major role in diverse AD related pathways, such as APP cleavage, Tau hyperphosphorylation, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) influence in insulin signalling efficiency and the insulin degrading enzyme, which is also the major Aβ degrading enzyme.
Growing evidence links AD with type 2 diabetes (T2D) due to impaired insulin signalling (IS) and brain insulin resistance. In a cohort based study in the Aveiro region, a correlation between diabetes and poor cognitive scores in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) test were observed, with a p-value of 0.072. Additionally, carriers of the allele ApoE-ɛ2 appeared to be protective against diabetes, in the literature the same allele appears to be protective for AD.
Posteriorly, the analysis of protein interactions, via the development of interactome networks, identified several proteins involved in both AD and the IS pathways. Also, by correlating these pathways with the synapse proteome, a very high overlap was observed (88% for AD, 79% for IS and 96% for AD and IS coincident proteins), enforcing the importance of both pathways in synaptic signalling and plasticity. From gene ontology studies, it was possible to assess the principal biological processes and molecular functions of the dataset of proteins. For AD, response to stimulus, cellular component organization, cell communication, signalling, protein binding, receptor binding and kinase binding were categories with elevated representation. Regarding coincident proteins between AD and IS pathways, an increase in all categories was observed, meaning that insulin plays a pivotal role in many AD events.
Finally, the analysis of SH-SY5Y differentiated cells treated with 0, 1, 10 and 100 nM of insulin for 0, 10 and 60 minutes, showed a decrease on the intracellular total levels of protein Tau and an increase in the phosphorylation at serine 396. Regarding the amyloid precursor protein (APP), increases in intracellular levels were observed, when treated with insulin for 10 minutes, followed by a decrease for 60 minutes exposure. The phosphorylation of APP at threonine 668, has previously been related to increased production of Aβ, by promoting APP cleavage via the amyloidogenic pathway. In cells treated with insulin, a clear increase was detected at the 10-minute time point. At 60 minutes, the levels of phosphorylation were low probably due to low total APP levels.A doença de Alzheimer (DA) é o tipo mais comum de demência no mundo. É caracterizada molecularmente pela deposição extracelular de placas senis (PS) compostas por agregados do péptido amiloide beta (Aβ), pela formação de emaranhados neurofibrilares (EN) derivados da hiperfosforilação da proteína Tau, pela disfunção sináptica devido aos depósitos de PS e EN e também pelo stress oxidativo induzido pelo enfraquecimento das vias metabólicas.
A via de sinalização da insulina desempenha um papel principal em diversas vias da DA, tal como na clivagem da APP, hiperfosforilação da proteína Tau, eficiência da sinalização da insulina influenciada pela Apolipoproteína E (ApoE) e pela enzima envolvida na degradação de insulina que também é a enzima principal na degradação de Aβ.
Crescente evidência relaciona a DA com a diabetes de tipo 2 (T2D) devido ao mau funcionamento da sinalização pela insulina e da resistência cerebral à mesma. Num estudo baseado num cohort da região de Aveiro, foi observada uma correlação entre a diabetes e um mau resultado no teste do ‘Mini Mental State Examination’. Adicionalmente, também foi observada uma correlação entre os portadores do alelo ApoE-ɛ2 e um estado protetor contra a T2D. Este alelo também foi observado na literatura como sendo protetor contra a DA.
Posteriormente, uma análise de interações entre proteínas, identificou várias proteínas envolvidas tanto na DA como na sinalização da insulina. Correlacionando estes dados com o proteoma da sinapse, foi possível observar que existe uma grande representação das duas condições e também das proteínas coincidentes às duas (88% para a DA, 79% para a sinalização da insulina e 96% para as proteínas relacionadas com ambas), reforçando o papel de ambas as vias na sinalização e plasticidade sináptica. Do estudo de ontologia genética para a DA, foi possível identificar diversas vias importantes, tais como, resposta a um estímulo, organização de componentes celulares, comunicação celular, ligação proteica e ligação a uma cinase. Em relação à sinalização da insulina, as mesmas categorias apareciam com maior representação, significando que a insulina tem um papel importante em muitos eventos da DA.
Por fim, o tratamento de SH-SY5Y diferenciadas com 0, 1, 10 e 100 nM de insulina por 0, 10 e 60 minutos mostraram uma diminuição nos níveis intracelulares da proteína Tau e um aumento na sua fosforilação na serina 396. Em relação à proteína percursora amiloide (APP), o tratamento de insulina levou a um aumento nos níveis intracelulares, quando exposta por 10 minutos seguido por uma diminuição aos 60 minutos. Quanto à fosforilação da treonina 668 da APP, foi previamente demonstrado que um aumento na fosforilação desse resíduo, promove a clivagem pela via amiloidogénica, levando à produção de Aβ. Nas células tratadas com insulina, um aumento claro da fosforilação desse resíduo da APP foi observado aos 10 minutos. Aos 60 minutos, os níveis da fosforilação eram baixos provavelmente devido aos baixos níveis de APP total"
5,Molecular Risk Factors of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,https://core.ac.uk/works/40188380,"The overall objective of the research presented in this dissertation was to investigate molecular risk factors of susceptibility to estrogenic chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hormone replacement therapy, and oral contraceptives and how that leads to the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Environmental and molecular risk factors for PAH are not clearly understood. This is a major hurdle for the development of new therapy against PAH as well as understanding individual susceptibility to this disease. Gender has been shown to impact the prevalence of PAH. Although controversial, estrogens have been implicated to be a risk factor for PAH. Thus, we hypothesize that women exposed to estrogenic chemicals are at increased risk of developing PAH when endocrine disrupting chemicals interact with unopposed estrogen to worsen pulmonary arterial disease. In support of this hypothesis, we have accomplished the following: Microarray data on PAH were collected and subsequent meta-analysis was conducted using genome-wide association and environment-wide association approaches on published studies as well as GEO and NHANES data. All PCB geometric mean concentrations found higher levels in people at risk of PAH than people not at risk of PAH. The sum of non-dioxin-like PCBs and the sum of dioxin-like PCBs were significantly higher in people at risk of PAH than people not at risk of PAH. Also, different levels of LOD (including PCBs concentration \u3eLOD, \u3e 50th percentile, 50th-75th percentile, and ≥75th percentile) were significantly higher in people at risk of PAH than people not at risk of PAH. We reported that females used estrogen pills and oral contraceptive were associated with risk of PAH. However, females used progestin and estrogen/progestin pills were not at risk of PAH. Molecular risk factor analysis using machine learning approaches revealed that VAMP2, LAMA5, POLR2C, VEGFB, and PRKCH genes are causal genes of PAH pathogenesis. Gene ontology and pathway analysis of PAH showed that genes involved in the apoptosis pathway, p53 pathway, Ras Pathway, T-cell activation, TGF-beta pathway, VEGF pathway, and Wnt pathway appear to be significantly associated with PAH. Documenting the exposure to estrogenic chemicals among the general U.S. population, and identifying agents and molecular risk factors associated with PAH have the potential to fill research gaps and facilitate our understanding of the complex role environmental chemicals play in producing toxicity in the lungs"
6,Rab-domain dynamics in endocytic membrane trafficking,https://core.ac.uk/works/71450095,"Eukaryotic cells depend on cargo uptake into the endocytic membrane system, which comprises a functionally interconnected network of endosomal compartments. The establishment and maintenance of such diverse compartments in face of the high rates of exchange between them, poses a major challenge for obtaining a molecular understanding of the endocytic system. Rab-GTPases have emerged as architectural key element thereof: Individual family members localize selectively to endosomal compartments, where they recruit a multitude of cytoplasmic effector proteins and coordinate them into membrane sub-domains. Such &amp;quot;Rab-domains&amp;quot; constitute modules of molecular membrane identity, which pattern the endocytic membrane system into a mosaic of Rab-domains. The main objective of this thesis research was to link such &amp;quot;static&amp;quot; mosaic-view with the highly dynamic nature of the endosomal system. The following questions were addressed: How are neighbouring Rab-domains coordinated? Are Rab-domains stable or can they undergo assembly and disassembly? Are the dynamics of Rab-domains utilized in cargo transport? The first part of this thesis research focused on the organization of Rab-domains in the recycling pathway. Utilizing Total Internal Reflection (TIRF) microscopy, Rab11-, but neither Rab4- nor Rab5-positive vesicles were observed to fuse with the plasma membrane. Rab4-positive membranes, however, could be induced to fuse in presence of Brefeldin A. Thus, these experiments complete the view of the recycling pathway by the following steps: a) Rab11-carriers likely mediate the return of recycling cargo to the surface; b) such carriers are presumably generated in an Arf-dependent fission reaction from Rab4-positive compartments. Rab11-chromatography was subsequently carried out in the hope of identifying Rab11-effectors functioning at the Rab4-Rab11 domain interface. An as yet uncharacterized ubiquitin ligase was identified, which selectively interacts with both Rab4 and Rab11. Contrary to expectations, however, the protein (termed RUL for *R*ab interacting *U*biquitin *L*igase) does not function in recycling,but appears to mediate trafficking between Golgi/TGN and endosomes instead.In order to address the dynamics of Rab-domains, fluorescently tagged Rab-GTPases were imaged during cargo transport reactions in living cells. Herefore high-speed/long-term imaging procedures and novel computational image analysis tools were developed. The application of such methodology to the analysis of Rab5-positive early endosomes showed that a) The amount of Rab5 associated with individual endosomes fluctuates strongly over time; b) such fluctuations can lead to the &amp;quot;catastrophic&amp;quot; loss of the Rab5-machinery from membranes; c) Rab5 catastrophe is part of a functional cycle of early endosomes, involving net centripetal motility, continuous growth and increase in Rab5 density. Next, the relevance of Rab5 catastrophe with respect to cargo transfer into either the recycling- or degradative pathway was examined. Recycling cargo (transferrin) could be observed to exit Rab5-positive early endosomes via the frequent budding of tubular exit carriers. Exit of degradative cargo (LDL) from Rab5-positive endosomes did not involve budding, but the rapid loss of Rab5 from the limiting membrane.Rab5-loss was further coordinated with the concomitant acquisition of Rab7, suggesting &amp;quot;Rab conversion&amp;quot; as mechanism of transport between early- and late endosomes.Altogether, this thesis research has shown that first, Rab-machineries can be acquired and lost from membranes. Second, such dynamics provide a molecular mechanism for cargo exchange between endosomal compartments. Jointly, these findings lead to the concept of Rab-domain dynamics modulation in /trans/ between neighbouring domains as mechanistic principle behind the dynamic organization of membrane trafficking pathways"

1,Functions and mechanisms of Rab46 in endothelial cells,https://core.ac.uk/works/8608041,"Endothelial cells maintain vascular integrity by regulating a number of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including haemostasis, thrombosis and inflammation. A pivotal contribution to these processes is the exocytosis of cargo from specialized endothelial storage organelles, namely Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). WPBs provide an intracellular storage pool of pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory mediators which can be differentially released in response to different stimuli. Ca2+ raising agonists such as thrombin and histamine, respectively released following vascular injury or an immunogenic insult, evoke WPB exocytosis. However, inappropriate and untimely exocytosis of WPBs can promote the pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory environment evident in cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms underlying differential cargo release in order to produce physiologically distinct responses are poorly understood. Some Rab GTPase family members, have been reported to be implicated in regulating the exocytosis of WPBs.

Here, we describe a novel Rab GTPase (Rab46) in endothelial cells that is located on WPBs. Super-resolution microscopy confirmed that Rab46 is juxtaposed to von Willebrand Factor (vWF), on the cytosolic side of individual WPBs, whilst quantitative imaging analysis suggested that Rab46 may regulate a subpopulation of WPBs. Interestingly, Rab46 was necessary for acute histamine, but not thrombin, WPB trafficking towards the perinuclear area identified as the Microtubule Organizing Centre (MTOC). Biochemical analysis and mass spectrometry was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying Rab46-dependent retrograde trafficking and the dynein heavy chain was identified as a candidate effector protein. Further biochemical experiments suggested a direct interaction between endogenous Rab46 and the dynein motor complex. Taken together, these results suggest that after acute histamine stimulation, dynein-bound Rab46 mediates retrograde transport of a subset of WPBs along microtubules to the MTOC.

These observations indicate Rab46 as a key regulator of differential WPB cargo secretion, allowing an appropriate acute pro-inflammatory response whilst avoiding release of excessive pro-thrombotic mediators. Characterization of in vivo model of Rab46 represents the beginning of understanding the physiological contribution of Rab46 as well as its response to pathological conditions. Understanding the Rab46/WPB signalling axis, both in vitro and in vivo, could be important for achieving better appreciation of how the endothelial cell fine-tunes it’s secretory response and thereby providing novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of endothelial dysfunction, which is often the trigger for cardiovascular diseases"
2,"Physically Informed Subtraction of a

String's Resonances from Monophonic,

Discretely Attacked Tones :

a Phase Vocoder Approach",https://core.ac.uk/works/82642520,"A method for the subtraction of a string's oscillations from monophonic,

plucked- or hit-string tones is presented. The remainder of the subtraction

is the response of the instrument's body to the excitation, and potentially

other sources, such as faint vibrations of other strings, background

noises or recording artifacts. In some respects, this method is similar to a

stochastic-deterministic decomposition based on Sinusoidal Modeling Synthesis

[MQ86, IS87]. However, our method targets string partials expressly,

according to a physical model of the string's vibrations described in this thesis.

Also, the method sits on a Phase Vocoder scheme. This approach has

the essential advantage that the subtraction of the partials can take place

\instantly"", on a frame-by-frame basis, avoiding the necessity of tracking the

partials and therefore availing of the possibility of a real-time implementation.

The subtraction takes place in the frequency domain, and a method

is presented whereby the computational cost of this process can be reduced

through the reduction of a partial's frequency-domain data to its main lobe.

In each frame of the Phase Vocoder, the string is encoded as a set of partials,

completely described by four constants of frequency, phase, magnitude

and exponential decay. These parameters are obtained with a novel method,

the Complex Exponential Phase Magnitude Evolution (CSPME), which is

a generalisation of the CSPE [SG06] to signals with exponential envelopes

and which surpasses the nite resolution of the Discrete Fourier Transform.

The encoding obtained is an intuitive representation of the string, suitable

to musical processing"

Earlier work showed that Klf9 functions in neuronal differentiation, but nothing was known of its target genes in neurons. I used the mouse hippocampus-derived cell line HT22 to identify Klf9 genomic targets. I engineered HT22 cells to express Klf9 under the control of the tet repressor, and used RNA sequencing to identify genes modulated by Klf9. I identified 567 genes repressed, and 201 induced by Klf9. I also engineered HT22 cells to co-express biotin ligase and a Klf9 fusion protein containing an N-terminal polypeptide that can be biotinylated. Using chromatin-streptavidin precipitation (ChSP) sequencing I identified 3,516 genomic regions where Klf9 associated. Seventy five percent were <1 kilobase from transcription start sites, and Klf9 associated in chromatin with 60% of repressed genes. Computer analysis revealed GC-rich consensus motifs at 98% of regions where Klf9 associated. Transient transfection assays showed that Klf9 repressed promoter activity, which was abrogated after mutation of GC-rich motifs. Expression analysis of a subset of Klf9 target genes in hippocampus of wild type and Klf9-null mice showed that all were dysregulated in the mutants. Gene ontology analysis revealed that Klf9 regulates genes involved in neuronal morphogenesis, neurotrophin signaling, apoptosis and cell division.
Analysis of my ChSP-seq data showed that Klf9 associated in chromatin with genes involved in the cellular circadian clock. Klf9 mRNA showed circadian oscillation in synchronized HT22 cells, and in mouse liver and hippocampus in vivo. Klf9 showed rhythmic association with several clock-output genes in mouse liver, supporting a role in regulating circadian gene expression. Forced expression of Klf9 repressed transcription of the clock-output gene Dbp and inhibited activation of the Dbp promoter by CLOCK/Bmal1, supporting that Klf9 antagonizes the CLOCK/Bmal1 complex that forms the positive limb of the circadian oscillator. My dissertation work represents the first analysis of Klf9 genomic targets in neurons, and supports a predominant repressor role for Klf9 in gene transcription. My findings also support that Klf9 acts as a novel component of the negative limb of the circadian clock.PhDNeuroscienceUniversity of Michigan, Horace H.

5,The interplay between α-synuclein and Rab GTPases: Insights into the molecular basis of synucleinopathies,https://core.ac.uk/works/48850418,"Mit fortschreitendem Durchschnittsalter der Bevölkerung gewinnen altersbedingte Krankheiten immer mehr an Signifikanz. Demenz und Einschränkungen der Beweglichkeit wirken sich auf Individuen sowie auf Familien aus, da die progressive Abnahme kognitiver und physischer Fähigkeiten ihren Tribut von der Lebensqualität Betroffener sowie den Pflegenden fordert. Morbus Parkinson (PD) ist eine neurodegenerative Erkrankung, welche sich durch Symptome des Bewegungsapparates äußert, bedingt durch degenerative Prozesse im Mittelhirn, und welche mit Veränderungen des Gemütszustandes, Verhaltens sowie Depression und Demenz fortschreiten können. PD betrifft in der Regel ältere Personen, jedoch wurden Gene verschiedener zellulärer Funktionen identifiziert, deren Mutation zu einer frühen oder gar juvenilen Ausprägung der Krankheit führen kann. Ein Hauptakteur in PD ist α-Synuclein (ASYN), ein kleines Protein welches in PD-typischen Proteinablagerungen gefunden wurde. Die zelluläre Funktion von ASYN ist immernoch unbekannt, Mutation oder Überexpression jedoch können zu einem hypermorphen Phänotyp führen und die Verbindung zu PD ist daher unumstritten. Studien haben gezeigt, dass ASYN mit Proteintransportwegen und der Aufstellung der Transportmaschinerie interferiert. Genetische Rasterstudien identifizierten Modulatoren von ASYN-Toxizität in Genclustern des Vesikeltransports. Ebenso konnten Studien in Hefe zeigen, dass Überexpression von ASYN diverse Transportwege stört, besonders zu beachten ist hier der ER-zu-Golgi Transportweg, welcher kritisch für Posttranslationale Modifikationen verschiedener Proteine ist. Des Weiteren greift ASYN-Pathologie störend in die Homöostase von Rab GTPasen ein, eine Proteinfamilie involviert in Vesikeltransport, manche deren Mitglieder ASYN-Toxizität reduzieren können. In dieser Studie zeigen wir in einer Rasteruntersuchung mit Rab GTPasen in einem Säugerzellmodell von ASYN-Proteinanreichungen, dass die ASYN-Pathologe zu einer weitreichenden Störung von Rab GTPase assoziierten Transportwegen führt. Wir identifizieren zwei unterschiedliche endosomale Stoffwechselwege welche beim Auftreten von ASYN-Proteinablagerungen fehlreguliert werden: der endosomale-lysosomale-Proteintransportweg welcher das frühe Endosom beinhaltet, sowie den trans-Golgi Netzwerk (TGN) Transportweg. Die kleinen Rab GTPasen Rab5A, Rab7 und Rab8A haben fundamentale Auswirkungen auf die Formation von ASYN-Proteinansammlungen, Sekretion und Toxizität. Wir zeigen dass Rab8A in der Lage ist ASYN-Proteinansammlungen zu modulieren und agiert protektiv in Bezug auf zelluläre Toxizitätslevel in unserem Modell. Rab5A, ein Protein des frühen Endosoms, fehllokalisiert mit Formation der Ablagerungen, während das lysosomale Rab7 die Anzahl der Ablagerungen erhöht, aber nicht ihnen kolokalisiert. Des Weiteren benutzen wir Größenexklusionschromatographie (SEC) und Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) um zu zeigen, dass Rab5A und Rab7 in Abhängigkeit ihres Aktivitätszustandes die Partikelgröße von ASYN ändert und die Sekretion moduliert. Die abschließende Bewertung eines Tiermodells welches humanes ASYN pan-neuronal überexpremiert zeigte, dass lysosomales Rab7 und die Protease Cathepsin D (CatD) in Hirnregionen verantwortlich für Bewegung, Motivation und Gedächtnis herausreguliert sind. Unsere Arbeit sowohl in Säugerzellkultur sowie in transgenen Tieren deutet darauf hin, dass die ASYN-Pathologie Auswirkungen auf das endosomale Transportsystem hat, aber zeigt auch die Fähigkeit von Proteinen, welche mit diesem Transportsystem assoziiert sind, die Toxizität von ASYN zu modulieren. Daher schließen wir, dass Anomalien in der Transportmaschinerie von Endosomen, welche durch Fehlregulation ASYN verursacht wurden, zur Entstehung der PD Pathologie beitragen"
6,PTH1R Signaling in Osteoblasts Stimulated with Functionally Selective Ligands: Phosphoproteomics Reveals Unique Signaling Networks,https://core.ac.uk/works/122958375,"The past 20 years have seen G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) theory advance significantly. Receptors are now thought of as adopting multiple conformations in a state of dynamic equilibrium. The study of GPCR biased agonism has emerged from this changing concept of receptors and introduced the field to “pluridimensional efficacy.” It is thought that a single readout of efficacy is no longer sufficient and multiple parameters of efficacy must be measured in drug screens to improve the ability to predict in vivo effects. While several GPCRs have multiple cognate ligands that elicit functionally-selective responses, the present study focused on biased signaling of the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) maintains serum calcium and is a key regulator of bone remodeling. Human PTH1-34 (Forteo) is the only FDA approved drug used for treatment of osteoporosis that acts via its anabolic actions on osteoblasts. However, the therapeutic utilization of PTH1-34 is limited by its catabolic effects, mediated in part by protein kinase A, which after two years culminate in net bone resporption through the activation of osteoclasts by RANKL. The experimental, biased ligand of the PTH1R, bovine parathyroid hormone residues 7-34 with D-Trp12 and Tyr34 (bPTH(7-34)), does not exhibit the catabolic effects of PTH1-34. In vivo administration of the conventional ligand, PTH 1-34, and the biased ligand, bPTH(7-34), for eight weeks increased bone mineral density (BMD) in mice. The anabolic effect of bPTH(7-34) in vivo was lost in β-arrestin deficient mice, revealing a dependence on β-arrestin mediated signaling. Further analysis of osteoblast and osteoclast number, transcript expression, and the generation of second messengers revealed the anabolic effect of each ligand was achieved by different mechanisms. To elucidate the unique, proximal signaling events activated by acute stimulation of the PTH1R with the biased agonist, this study focused on characterization and comparison of the phosphorylation-mediated signaling profiles of osteoblasts stimulated with each osteogenic agonist. Relative changes in phosphorylation were measured using a SILAC-based phosphoproteomic screen following acute stimulation of MC3T3- E1 preosteoblast cells with hPTH(1-34) or bPTH(7-34) for 5 minutes. The experiments were performed in proliferating preosteoblasts (Day 0) and differentiating osteoblasts (Day 10). Over ten thousand sites of phosphorylation were observed. Regulated phosphosites and phosphoproteins were examined for putative kinase activity, targeted signaling pathways, and biological processes. Differences were observed in the kinases stimulated by each agonist. For example, bPTH(7-34) treatment activated MAPK1 and increased phosphorylation of downstream substrates, while phosphorylation of predicted MAPK1 substrates were decreased with hPTH(1-34) activation. While both drugs regulated phosphorylation of proteins in signaling pathways involving GPCR signaling (PLC, MTOR, Rho GTPases); Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) also revealed discrete signaling networks engaged by each drug. PTH (1-34) treatment yielded regulated proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and the Wnt/β- catenin pathway, whereas bPTH(7-34) treatment modulated pathways related to survival (ATM, CDKs, and p70S6K) and transcription (Jak/Stat, and PPARα). Cell-based assays confirmed hPTH(1-34) and bPTH(7-34) both confer resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis and bPTH(7-34) increases proliferation in MC3T3-E1 cells. At the biological process level, both ligands modulated proteins involved in cell survival, migration, growth, and bone metabolism. Comparison of regulated phosphoproteins at two time points during osteogenic differentiation unexpectedly revealed that the bPTH(7-34) gave a more robust effect in proliferating preosteoblasts, whereas hPTH(1-34) stimulated more sites of phosphorylation in differentiating osteoblasts. This observation indicates the differential effects of each agonist may result from changes in signaling mediators that are expressed at these two time points. While the PTH receptor was present at both time points, β-arrestin was more highly expressed in proliferating preosteoblasts"
7,Defining Gene Expression in Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes and Melanocytes: A Prerequisite for Understanding Hyperplastic and Neoplastic Pathology,https://core.ac.uk/works/47662743,"To define pathologic alterations, a reference of  normal  cells is needed in order to interpret genomic methods that study gene expression of melanocytes and keratinocytes in growth-activated or neoplastic skin diseases. Historically, mRNAs isolated from cultured epidermal keratinocytes or melanocytes are used to define normal gene expression patterns. In this study, we profiled global gene expression in human epidermal keratinocytes on Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays from three different  normal  sources: 1) cultured keratinocytes, 2) FACS keratinocytes from dispase-separated epidermis, and 3) laser-capture microdissected (LCM) epidermis. For melanocytes, the precursor cell of melanoma, the attempt was made to isolate a more physiologically relevant sample source than that of the forced in vitro proliferating phenotype. Our results suggested that the best definition of  normal  keratinocyte gene expression is obtained via LCM of normal epidermis. Even short-term suspension culture of KCs (used for FACS) altered gene expression. Established primary KCs in culture express some genes, e.g., keratin 16, at levels found in pathologic states such as psoriasis. Currently limited by LCM methodology, the identification of melanocyte was defined by c-kit+ FACS samples, using the caveats of this technique acknowledged in the keratinocyte comparison. The results of the gene expression analysis show a modulation of many important keratinocyte genes based on whether and how long they were in culture. Overall, our results indicate the need to carefully consider  normal  in situ sources of cells in order to properly define normal vs. pathologic gene expression"
8,Genome-wide DNA methylation changes in a mouse model of infection-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders,https://core.ac.uk/works/54690343,"Background
Prenatal exposure to infectious or inflammatory insults increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Using a well-established mouse model of prenatal viral-like immune activation, we examined whether this pathological association involves genome-wide DNA methylation differences at single nucleotide resolution.

Methods
Prenatal immune activation was induced by maternal treatment with the viral mimetic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid in middle or late gestation. Following behavioral and cognitive characterization of the adult offspring (n = 12 per group), unbiased capture array bisulfite sequencing was combined with subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses to quantify DNA methylation changes and transcriptional abnormalities in the medial prefrontal cortex of immune-challenged and control offspring. Gene ontology term enrichment analysis was used to explore shared functional pathways of genes with differential DNA methylation.

Results
Adult offspring of immune-challenged mothers displayed hyper- and hypomethylated CpGs at numerous loci and at distinct genomic regions, including genes relevant for gamma-aminobutyric acidergic differentiation and signaling (e.g., Dlx1, Lhx5, Lhx8), Wnt signaling (Wnt3, Wnt8a, Wnt7b), and neural development (e.g., Efnb3, Mid1, Nlgn1, Nrxn2). Altered DNA methylation was associated with transcriptional changes of the corresponding genes. The epigenetic and transcriptional effects were dependent on the offspring\u2019s age and were markedly influenced by the precise timing of prenatal immune activation.

Conclusions
Prenatal viral-like immune activation is capable of inducing stable DNA methylation changes in the medial prefrontal cortex. These long-term epigenetic modifications are a plausible mechanism underlying the disruption of prefrontal gene transcription and behavioral functions in subjects with prenatal infectious histories"
9,In vitro reconstitution of the molecular mechanisms of vesicle tethering and membrane fusion,https://core.ac.uk/works/71452654,"Eukaryotic cells are populated by membrane-enclosed organelles possessing discrete molecular and biochemical properties. Communication between organelles is established by shuttling vesicles that transport proteins and other molecules. Vesicles bud from a donor organelle, travel in the cytosol, and are delivered to a target organelle. All these steps are regulated to ensure that cargoes are transported in a specific and directed manner.
The focus of this thesis is on the last part of the journey of a vesicle: the process of vesicle targeting. Two phases can be distinguished in this process: vesicle tethering, defined as the first interaction between the shuttling vesicle and the target membrane, and membrane fusion, which is the mixing of the lipid bilayers and of lumen content. Both phases are mediated by a minimal set of molecular components that include one member of the family of Rab GTPases, a vesicle tethering factor, a phosphoinositide lipid, and four SNAREs together with their regulatory proteins. 
While many studies have investigated the molecular details of how SNAREs mediate membrane fusion, the process of vesicle tethering is less well understood. The overall scope of my study is to describe the molecular details of vesicle tethering and how they can contribute to the general process of vesicle targeting.
To address this question I developed an in vitro assay where I reconstitute in vitro the process of vesicle tethering. This bottom-up approach allows the molecular dissection of cellular processes outside of the complex context of the cell. With this assay I have characterized the vesicle tethering abilities of individual proteins involved in vesicle tethering on early endosomes. I show that a minimal vesicle tethering machinery can be formed by the concomitant interaction between one vesicle tethering factor and a phosphoinositide on the membrane of one vesicle, and by a vesicle tethering factor and a Rab GTPase on the membrane of another vesicle.
These results provide an explanation for how vesicle tethering contributes to the specificity of vesicle targeting and to the directionality of cargo transport. In particular, specificity of vesicle targeting can arise from the specific interaction between a Rab and a vesicle tethering factor that is an effector of the Rab. I show that the asymmetric distribution of binding sites in the structure of a vesicle tethering factor can generate a heterotypic vesicle tethering reaction that can account for the directionality of cargo transport. The outcome of this thesis emphasizes the role that vesicle tethering factors have in the self-organized system of vesicle trafficking of eukaryotic cells.

To identify novel Rab5 effectors implicated in vesicle tethering, I carried out a Rab5-chromatography on mouse liver. Amongst other novel Rab5 effectors, I identify a multi-subunit vesicle tethering complex that was not previously characterized in mammalian cells. The complex, named CORVET, is conserved from yeast to humans and plays a major role in cell physiology since its removal causes embryonic death in mice. I define its subunits composition, determine its subcellular localization, and elucidate its role in cargo transport. This finding reconciles a disharmony between findings in mammals and yeast regarding the molecular machinery responsible for the conversion from early to late endosomes. I also show that the newly identified subunit of the mammalian CORVET complex is the only Rab5 effector to localize to autophagosomes. I hypothesise that it is through the CORVET complex that Rab5 is involved in the formation and maturation of autophagosomes"
0,Molecular mechanisms of acquired gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer,https://core.ac.uk/works/43411936,"Indiana University-Purdue University (IUPUI)Most pancreatic cancer patients receiving gemcitabine chemotherapy eventually develop resistance to gemcitabine. To improve survival and prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients, better understanding the mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance and discovery of new therapeutic targets are required. In this study, I investigated the molecular mechanisms of acquired gemcitabine resistance using a stepwise gemcitabine-selected pancreatic cancer cell line in comparison to the parental cell line. I found that 14-3-3&#963; is up-regulated in the drug resistant cell line due to demethylation in its first exon, and the up-regulation of 14-3-3&#963; gene expression, in turn, contributes to gemcitabine resistance. Intriguingly, I found that demethylation of the 14-3-3&#963; gene in gemcitabine resistant cells is reversibly regulated by DNMT1 and UHRF1. Furthermore, I found that 14-3-3&#963; over-expression causes gemcitabine resistance by inhibiting gemcitabine-induced apoptosis and caspase-8 activation possibly via binding to YAP1. The finding of demethylation of the 14-3-3&#963; gene in gemcitabine resistant cells led to a hypothesis that other genes may also be changed epigenetically following gemcitabine selection. By RRBS (Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing) analysis, 845 genes were found to have altered methylation. One of these genes, PDGFD, was further investigated and found to have reversible demethylation at its promoter region in the drug resistant cells and contribute to gemcitabine resistance possibly via autocrine activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. Together, these findings not only provide evidence that 14-3-3&#963; and PDGFD over-expression contribute to acquired gemcitabine resistance and that reversible epigenetic changes may play an important role in acquired gemcitabine resistance, but also demonstrate that the molecular mechanisms of acquired gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer cells are complex and multifaceted"
1,An Examination Of The Cytoplasmic Dynein Stepping Mechanism At The Single Molecule Level,https://core.ac.uk/works/19092448,"Rotational motions play important roles within biological processes. These motions can drive energy production as with the F1-ATP synthase or accompany domain motions during a conformational change such as the relative rotation of the large and small ribosomal subunits during protein synthesis. Studying these motions can provide insight into the mechanics of enzyme function that cannot be obtained by measuring its localization or chemical output alone. Rotational tracking can be done in the context of single molecule studies to observe enzymatic function at the single particle level. This presents an advantage over bulk solution studies because simultaneously occurring events, such as a solution of enzymes catalyzing a reaction, are not necessarily identical. By measuring the motions of a single molecule, short-lived states and rare events that would otherwise be averaged out can be detected. Here single molecule rotational tracking is utilized to examine the stepping mechanism of the cellular transport motor, cytoplasmic dynein. Cytoplasmic dynein walks along microtubules toward the minus end and is responsible for a wide range of cellular functions including cargo transport and chromosome alignment during cell division. This work employs a position and rotational tracking method, polarized total internal reflection fluorescence (polTIRF) microscopy. This technique requires a polarized fluorescent probe that is rigidly attached to the protein domain of interest and an optical system capable of measuring the orientation of such a probe. A functionalization method was developed to water-solubilize CdSe/CdS semiconductor quantum nanorods, which have polarized fluorescence emission, and coat them with the biotin binding protein, NeutrAvidin, in order to attach them to biotinylation sites within the dynein ring. A method was also developed to quantify the number and density of functional biotin binding sites on the nanorod surface and compare it to that of commercially available streptavidin quantum dots. These nanorods were attached to cytoplasmic dynein via two inserted biotinylation sites in AAA5 and AAA6 of the ring domain and rotational motions of the dynein ring were measured in real time using a home-built optical system capable of measuring both position and orientation simultaneously. These measurements revealed small, frequent ring rotations that occurred more than twice as frequently as steps along the microtubule track. The observed ring rotations are too small to be attributed to a classic powerstroke mechanism in which large-scale tilting produces forward motion, but instead support a flexible stalk model where tension between the two dynein heads, produced by conformational changes of the linker domain, results in bending of the flexible coiled-coil stalk and hinging at the microtubule binding domain"
2,SELECTIVE REGULATION OF CARDIOMYOCYTE SIGNALING BY RGL2,https://core.ac.uk/works/69227158,"A key cardiovascular signaling molecule involved in both physiologic and pathologic regulation of cardiomyocytes is the small molecular weight G-protein, Ras. Differential effects of Ras are mediated by multiple effector molecules, including the RalGEFs which activate Ral. Studies performed in cardiomyocytes have indicated a role for Ral in cardiac hypertrophic signaling and the RalGEF family member, Rgl2, was shown to specifically interact with Ras in the heart. Therefore, I hypothesized that Rgl2 was an important Ras effector that would regulate cardiomyocyte signaling.
To elucidate the potential importance of Rgl2 in regulating cardiomyocyte signaling, a gain-of-function approach was utilized in which NRVMs were infected with an adenovirus to increase Rgl2 expression. Using this approach, I found that Rgl2 increased Ral-GTP levels, Ras-GTP levels, and PI3-kinase-Akt signaling, but decreased ERK phosphorylation. Overall, my results suggest a model in which Rgl2 disrupts Ras-Raf and Ras-RasGAP interaction to decrease ERK phosphorylation and increase Ras-GTP, respectively. Furthermore, Rgl2-induced Ral activation promotes the enhanced PI3- kinase-Akt signaling. The physiologic consequence of Rgl2 signaling is difficult to predict, but the increase in PI3-kinase-Akt signaling would be expected to promote cardiomyocyte survival and enhance cardiac function, both of which are characteristic of physiologic hypertrophy"

A brief review on the historical milestones of genetics, the creation and popularization of the fast throughput DNA sequencing technologies and their advantages and potential problems and biases, the importance of the study of canine genetics and the current state of the canine genome assembly is presented. Our lab sequenced [about]100 dogs in the attempt to discover disease-causing variants. So far 20 such variants have been identified. This dissertation contains detailed accounts of the discovery variants likely to be responsible for four canine diseases.

4,The role of PLK1 in Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection of the liver,https://core.ac.uk/works/19158123,"With 250 million reported chronic infections globally, Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a major human health issue, linked to increased risk for development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Current treatments to control chronic HBV infection remain ineffective. New and effective therapies that target the persisting viral molecules are needed in order to clear infection. My research aims to understand the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in inducing HCC and identify novel host molecules that are targeted by HBV. Understanding how HBV modifies and manipulates host cellular pathways is critical for the development of mechanism based therapeutics. Here, I provide a review for the HBV core protein (HBc), its function and the host molecules it usurps during infection and pathogenesis. I also identify Polo-like-kinase 1 (PLK1) as a proviral factor in HBV pathogenesis. I demonstrate by loss of function as well as gain of function approaches that PLK1 inhibition suppresses viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. I also show that HBc is a phosphorylation substrate for PLK1 in vitro and I mapped the PLK1 phosphorylation sites to HBc residues S168, S176 and S178. Finally, I used a global proteomics approach to study human HBc interactome identifying potential interacting partners with interesting links to viral pathogenesis. Collectively, my research expands our understanding of the role of HBc in HBV pathogenesis and the ensuing transformation of the liver"
5,Genetic and gene expression analysis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC),https://core.ac.uk/works/8503794,"We examined both the chromosomal copy number changes and differential RNA expression profiles in Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Gene expression profiles identified a large number of differentially regulated genes involved in diverse functional processes, while genetic analysis detected extensive genomic abnormalities including large and small, discrete regions of copy number change and loci that exhibit uniparental disomy (UPD). The relationship between chromosomal copy number and level of gene expression were analysed. This revealed that the direct copy number/expression link applies in about 60% of the instances of copy number loss/down-expression and less than 35% of instances of copy number gain/up-expression that were examined. Signalling pathway analysis revealed that numerous components involved in the TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog pathways were universally upregulated in NPC tumours, and gene expression pattern of the C666-1 cell line approximated to other NPC tumours, indicating that it is a good tumour model. A preliminary in vitro investigation of signalling pathways revealed that the C666-1 cell line is intact in the activin and Hh signalling pathways but not in the TGF-β pathway. However, the C666-1 cells appear to resist activin-mediated cell growth inhibitio"

8,Use of laser capture microdissection to generate a translational map of gene expression patterns in the liver,https://core.ac.uk/works/50766476,"Animal models are widely used in toxicology studies of new chemical compounds. The metabolism of drugs occurs largely in the liver, but interspecies differences in the molecular mechanisms at the basis of drug metabolism have been widely demonstrated. These differences may limit the translatability of the results to human, and compromise the safety assessment for new compounds. Urge therefore a more in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of liver for the selection of suitable animal models, which are the most representative for the human. In addition an in-depth knowledge of the cells specific transcriptome may drastically improve the identification of the target organ of toxicity.

Accordingly, in this experimental work we focused our attention in generating a molecular map of liver gene expression for different animal models, taking advantage from the use of laser capture microdissection for obtaining cell-specific transcriptomes, from rat, dog and monkey liver slices.

We developed LCM and immuno-LCM protocols for liver zone I, liver zone III, bile ducts, hepatic arteries and portal veins specimen collection and we profiled the transcriptomes of these samples by oligonucleotide arrays.

The analysis confirmed the enrichment of specific cells/tissues and allowed the identification of known and unknown tissue-specific genes.

We have then investigated the impact of sexual dimorphism on the expression of zone specific genes. We showed that sexual dimorphism in liver zonation is a phenomenon interesting only rats and we couldn’t observe any significant differentially expressed gene in other species.

The cross species comparison of gene signature for liver zone I, III and bile ducts, revealed a surprising low number of common genes. However this data might be dependent from technical limitations more than from actual biological diversity of similar tissues in different species.

The specificity of our gene signatures has been proved, at protein level, by IHC, resulting in all the cases valid and revealing additional species specificities unknown so far.

We have applied the knowledge generated in the first phase of this project to a retrospective case study on toxic effects of Methapyrilene in rat liver.

The histopathology report described minimal histological changes in treated animals, including single cell necrosis, increase of mitotic figures and bile duct hyperplasia.

At transcriptomic level, the exposure to Methapyrilene induced a mild impact on the global liver gene expression, and a specific gene expression pattern of toxicity was not detectable.

The analysis of differentially expressed genes, revealed 1500 up regulated genes in treated animals vs. controls and the comparison of those genes with the bile duct gene signature revealed a constant number (120-130) of common genes at all the time points.

Using two markers belonging to rat bile duct signature (Cldn7 and Krt19), we were able to quantitatively evaluate the bile duct hyperplasia, by measuring the area covered by labeled cells. However the revealed differences were statistically significant at day 7 and 14, but not at day 3.

The generation of a liver gene expression map and of tissue specific signatures allowed an “informed” whole liver transcriptome analysis. This uncommon approach revealed subtle drug induced molecular changes and histological alterations, otherwise difficult to identify.

Interestingly, the transcriptomic profiling resulted more sensitive and statistically powerful than the histological approach. 

We can then conclude that, although a mathematical model describing the empirical approach used in this project is still missing, the knowledge generated by our work improved the interpretation of a retrospective case study, allowing the identification of a specific toxicity pattern. 

Additionally, the possibility to apply the same approach in prospective studies and to different species, represents a powerful contribution for the understanding of liver pathophysiology and DILI"
9,Protein Phosphatase 2a Interactions In Islet And Human Skeletal Muscle In Diabetes,https://core.ac.uk/works/40502042,"Type 2 Diabetes is a metabolic disorder associated with insulin resistance and consequent high blood glucose levels. Under normal conditions, in response to high blood glucose levels, pancreatic beta cells produce insulin. The secreted insulin is dis-tributed to tissues thereby stimulating insulin stimulated glucose uptake. However, maximum glucose disposal takes place in skeletal muscle. Thus, studying beta cells  and skeletal muscle in respect to diabetes is crucial. Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is one of the major serine/threonine phosphatases belonging to PhosphoProteinPhospha-tase (PPP) family. It constitutes about 80% of all serine/threonine phosphatases. It is regulated by numerous regulatory subunits as well as other substrate molecules and post translational modifications. This alters their localization, activity and its target molecules. Many evidences show the effect of insulin on PP2Ac and its abnormal reg-ulation in conditions of glucolipotoxicity. Thus, studying PP2Ac interaction partners in respect to type 2 diabetes will give insight into its role in insulin resistance.
Here, we studied interaction partners of PP2Ac in both beta cells and human skeletal muscle. INS-1 832/13 insulin secreting cells are used to study beta cell which are treated with basal and high glucose for 48hrs which are then harvested and ana-lyzed. Skeletal muscle biopsies are collected from human subjects. Two biopsies are collected from each individual, basal and insulin stimulated using hyperinsulenemic euglycemic clamp technique. We collected biopsies from individuals characterized in three different groups, lean controls, obese/overweight insulin resistant, and type 2 diabetics. Both beta cells and human skeletal muscle biopsies are analyzed using a sim-ilar proteomics approach using ESI-HPLC-MS/MS. Using this technique, we identi-fied 514 partners in INS-1 832/13 cells with 89 partners classified as glucose respon-sive. Similarly, 211 interaction partners are identified in human skeletal muscle biop-sies and 69 proteins presented a significant difference among three gropus. Several important PP2Ac interaction partners were identified which included some known partners (identified in other cell types) as well. Many proteins involved in insulin se-cretion are found as PP2Ac partners in beta cells whereas several vital molecules in-volved in insulin signaling pathway are identified in skeletal muscle biopsies. Some important molecules like Rac1, Limk1, Akt2, MAPK are identified among others.

0,An old protein in unexpected places: alpha- and beta- globin expression in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons and glial cells,https://core.ac.uk/works/9386439,"Dopaminergic neurons (DA) are an anatomically and functionally heterogeneous group of cells involved in a wide range of neuronal network activities and behaviour. Among them, mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons (mDA) are the major source of dopamine in the brain. They present two main groups of projecting cells: the A9 neurons of the Substantia Nigra (SN) and the A10 cells of the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA). A9 neurons form the nigrostriatal pathway and are involved in regulating voluntary movements and postural reflexes. Their selective degeneration leads to Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and the loss of DA synapses in the striatum is believed to be primary cause for the disruption of the ability to control movements (E. Hirsch et al. 1988). A10 cells constitute the mesocorticolimbic pathway playing a fundamental role in reward and attention. Their abnormal function has been linked to schizophrenia, attention deficit and addiction while they are relatively spared in PD (Meyer-Lindenberg et al. 2002). The description of the repertory of genes of mDA neurons may provide crucial information on their physiology as well as on the mechanisms of cell-type specific
dysfunction. Interestingly, in previous gene expression profiling experiments, mDA cells groups presented a limited number of differentially expressed genes with A9-enriched transcripts mainly related to energy metabolism and mitochondrial function (C. Y. Chung et al. 2005; James G Greene et al. 2005). A crucial requirement for metabolically active aerobic cells is a steady supply of oxygen. To this purpose, hemoglobin-like molecules occur widely in organisms ranging form
bacteria to human (Vandergon 1998). Vertebrate hemoglobin is the oxygen- and carbon dioxide-carrying protein in cells of erythroid lineage and is responsible for oxygen delivery to the respiring tissues of the body. Additional vertebrate heme-containing proteins with structural homology to globin chains include cytoglobin, mostly described in connective tissues (M. Schmidt et al. 2004), and neuroglobin, broadly expressed in the
brain (Burmester 2000; Burmester 2004). Surprisingly, hemoglobin chains have been recently detected in non-erythroid cells including macrophages, alveolar cells, eye\u2019s lens and mesangial cells of the kidney
(Dugas et al. 2006; L. Liu et al. 1999; Newton et al. 2006; Nishi et al. 2008).
By a combination of different gene expression platforms with Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), we have identified the transcripts of hemoglobin alpha, adult chain 1 (Hba-a1) and hemoglobin beta, adult chain 1 (Hbb-b1) in A9 neurons. Interestingly, Hemoglobin-ImmunoReactivity (Hb-IR) decorated the large majority of A9 cells while stained only less than 5% of A10 neurons. Furthermore, we detected
hemoglobin expression in almost all oligodendrocytes as well as in cortical and hippocampal astrocytes and proved that this pattern of expression was conserved in mammals. Importantly, A9 DA neurons from human post mortem brain showed hemoglobin expression. By gene expression analysis of mouse dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell lines stably transfected with alpha- and beta-chains, we observed changes in genes involved in oxygen homeostasis as well as in oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting a link between hemoglobin and mitochondrial activity. These results open a new scenario for hemoglobin role in brain physiology and in PD pathogenesis"
1,Global gene expression during muscle hypertrophy induced by myostatin suppression and/or beta-adrenergic agonist,https://core.ac.uk/works/19017237,"Ph.D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011.Includes bibliographical references.Skeletal muscle growth is important for animal agriculture, particularly for meat-producing animals, and for human health as well. A better understanding of the mechanisms regulating skeletal muscle growth is expected to contribute to improving the efficiency of meat animal production and alleviating human suffereings caused by muscle atrorphic conditions. Currently, two molecules have been shown to have dramatic effects on skeletal muscle mass: myostatin and β-adrenergic agonists.
Myostatin (Mstn), a member of the TGF-β superfamily proteins, acts as a potent negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. Suppression of Mstn by varying means has shown to increase skeletal muscle mass of animals. Administration of β-adrenergic agonist (BAA) such as clenbuterol (CL) induces dramatic increase in skeletal muscle mass or inhibits muscle atrophy.
Although there have been numerous demonstrations of the muscle growth--promoting effect of BAA administration or Mstn suppression, the effect of a combination of BAA administration and Mstn inhibition on skeletal muscle growth has not been investigated. Similarly, very little is known about the molecular signaling pathways leading to muscle hypertrophy induced by the two stimuli and the genes that are commonly regulated by both Mstn and BAA administration. Therefore, the objectives of this study were 1) to investigate the combined effect of Mstn-suppression and BAA administration on skeletal muscle growth, 2) to examine the role of the Akt/mTOR pathway in the two muscle hypertrophic models, 3) to examine global changes in gene expression in skeletal muscle undergoing hypertrophy induced by chronic suppression of Mstn or BAA administration , and 4) to compare the changes in gene expression between these two muscle hypertrophic models.
We used a transgenic mouse strain that overexpresses the Mstn-prodomain (Mstn-pro) and exhibits a significant increase in skeletal muscle mass regardless of age and sex. Clenbuterol (CL) was used as a BAA compound. Heterozygous Mstn-pro and wild-type littermates were produced and were given 0 or 20 ppm of CL in their drinking water. Phosphorylation of molecules involved in the Akt/mTOR pathway was examined by using the Western blot analysis. RNA samples of the gastrocnemius muscle in each group were subjected to microarray analysis using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse 430-2.0 platform.
CL increased body and muscle mass of male and female mice in both genotypes, indincating that the muscle-hypertrophic effect of CL is additive to the effect of Mstn suppression. Levels of phosphorylated muscle 4E-BP1 and p70S6k, two downstream effectors of the mTOR pathway, were higher in Mstn-pro mice than in wild type mice.
Levels of phosphorylated muscle Akt, an upstream effector of the mTOR pathway, were also higher in Mstn-pro mice than in wild type mice, indicating that the Akt/mTOR anabolic pathway is involved in the regulation of muscle mass by Mstn. CL increased the phosphorylation of Akt, 4E-BP1 and p70S6k in both genotypes, resulting in the highest phosphorylation levels of Akt, 4E-BP1 and p70S6k in CL-fed Mstn-pro mice.
This result suggests that like Mstn, BAA also regulates muscle hypertrophy through the Akt/mTOR pathway, and the pathways of Mstn and CL signaling converge to the Akt/mTOR anabolic pathway to regulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy.
Microarray analysis of global gene expression showed that Mstn suppression and CL administration induced significant changes in the mRNA abundance of various genes associated with muscle contraction, initiation of translation, transcription, and muscle hypertrophic signal pathway, suggesting that increased protein synthesis is partly responsible for the hypetrophy induced by Mstn and CL. Additionally, the alteration of Igf2 obsderved in Mstn suppressed mice, and the alterations of eIF4e, Acvr2b, FoxO and PTEN observed in mice treated with CL indicate that the pathways of Mstn and CL signaling converge to the Akt/mTOR anabolic pathway to regulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy"
2,RNA Editing at Baseline and Following Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.,https://core.ac.uk/works/37682491,"RNA sequences are expected to be identical to the DNA template. However, some RNA processing steps, such as RNA editing, can lead to differences in the RNA sequence that affect the fate of the RNA transcripts or the resultant proteins. My thesis focuses on the regulation of the canonical A-to-G editing and non-canonical RNA-DNA sequence Differences (RDD). My work contributed to the identification of RDDs throughout the human transcriptome. We identified all 12 types of single base differences across multiple individuals and various tissue types. We also detected peptides matching the RDD-encoded sequences suggesting that RDDs are translated into proteins. In subsequent work, we found that the non-canonical RDDs are found in nascent RNA. Through the use of nuclear run-on assays, we found that RDD occurs within seconds of exiting the RNA polymerase complex. 
Chapters 4 and 5 discuss my study of canonical A-to-G editing mediated by Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR). First, we found that A-to-G editing levels differ across individuals. I searched for and identified genetic variants whose alleles are associated with editing levels of sites in the same gene. These data demonstrate that ADAR editing is cis regulated and can lead to individual variability in editing levels. Furthermore, by utilizing individual variability in editing and studying the relationship between editing sites, I learned how ADAR edits multiple sites in a given transcript. My data support a model where ADAR edits multiple sites along one side of a double-stranded RNA structure. To learn about the biological significance of RNA editing, I focused on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. I found that editing levels change following ER stress suggesting that these RNA processing steps play a role in the ER stress response. Together, this work sheds light on the regulation of RNA editing and RDDs in the human transcriptome and aids in the understanding of how these processes may play a role in cellular response to stress.PhDHuman GeneticsUniversity of Michigan, Horace H.

6,Epigenome-Wide Association of Infant feeding and changes in DNA methylation from Birth to 10 years,https://core.ac.uk/works/123007448,"Epigenetic markers have been suggested as mediators of early-life nutrition to future health. Prior studies focused on breastfeeding effects on DNA methylation (DNAm), ignoring other feeding modes.   In this analysis of the Isle of Wight birth cohort, feeding modes were categorized as exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), exclusive formula feeding (EFF), and mixed feeding based on whether the respective feeding mode lasted for at least 3 months. In addition, in the past, infant feeding modes were assessed using one time point DNAm in childhood, not changes of DNAm. In this paper, methylation differences (Delta DNAm) were calculated by subtracting residual methylation values (adjusting for cell types and season of blood collection at both ages) at birth from age 10 years. These deltas were estimated for all methylation sites where cytosine was followed by guanines (CpG sites). Then we performed an epigenome-wide association study contrasting EBF, EFF, and mixed feeding with delta DNAm that represents changes in DNAm from birth to 10 years.   A total of 87 CpGs (EBF: 27 CpGs, EFF: 48 CpGs, mixed: 12 CpGs) were identified using separate linear regression models adjusting for confounders and multiple testing. Interestingly, the sum of all changes in methylation from birth to age 10 years was significantly lower in the EFF group. Correspondingly, the number of CpG sites with a methylation decline was 4.7% higher.   Lower methylation related to exclusive formula feeding and its adverse potential for the child’s development needs future research to reduce adverse health effects"

However, due to the relative accessibility of sequence information compared to structure information, most large genomics studies currently use only sequence-based annotation tools to analyze the function of expressed molecules. In this thesis, I introduce two novel computational methods for genome-scale structure-function analysis and demonstrate their application to identifying RNA and protein structures involved in synaptic plasticity and potentiation—important neuronal processes that are thought to form the basis of learning and memory. First, I describe a new method for de novo identification of RNA secondary structure motifs enriched in co-regulated transcripts. I show that this method can accurately identify secondary structure motifs that recur across three or more transcripts in the input set with an average recall of 0.80 and precision of 0.98. Second, I describe a tool for predicting protein structural fold from amino acid sequence, which achieves greater than 96% accuracy on benchmarks and can be used to predict protein function and identify new structural folds. Importantly, both of these tools scale linearly with increasing numbers of input sequences, making them feasible to run on thousands of sequences at a time. Finally, I use these tools to investigate RNA localization and local translation in dendrites—two processes that are prerequisites for long-lasting synaptic potentiation. Using soma- and dendrite-specific RNA-sequencing data as a starting point, I define the full set of RNAs localized to the dendrites, identify novel secondary structure motifs enriched in these RNAs that may act as dendritic localization signals, and predict the structure of all proteins that would be produced by these localized RNAs during local translation. The results shed new light on potential regulatory mechanisms of dendritic localization and roles of locally translated proteins at the synapse, and demonstrate the utility of structure-based tools in genomics analysis"
0,Iron Regulation of Macrophage Responses to Uropathogenic E. coli,https://core.ac.uk/works/69665343,"Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) are the principal cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs), one of the most common infections globally. Given the rising incidence of antibiotic resistance among UPEC strains, there is an increasing need to better understand the host response to UPEC and to develop ways to harness the bladder innate immune response that clears infection. In response to infection, the host attempts to limit the ability of UPEC to access iron, a metal critical to UPEC survival. Innate immune cells known as macrophages are known to regulate iron homeostasis through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, though it remains unclear what role macrophage iron regulation plays during a UTI. Bladder macrophages are also known to phagocytose UPEC via pathogen-recognition receptors. Innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells may also use these receptors to clear host apoptotic cells and debris, promoting tissue repair following UPEC infection. Macrophage scavenger receptor expression is known to be negatively regulated by genes involved in autophagy, a pathway for the degradation of intracellular components. This may implicate autophagy genes in the host response to UPEC. Furthermore, the autophagy protein ATG16L1 is also known to limit production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote UPEC clearance. It remains unclear, however, whether ATG16L1 mediates this effect primarily through inhibition of the macrophage inflammatory response to UPEC. In this thesis, I investigated the role of inflammatory cytokines, ATG16L1, iron regulation, and scavenger receptors in the innate immune response to UPEC.
I found that ATG16L1 suppressed the host response to UPEC by suppressing macrophage IL-1 production. Furthermore, macrophages, in response to UPEC infection, retained free iron and took up iron bound to UPEC siderophores, thereby limiting UPEC survival by preventing UPEC from accessing iron. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was required for macrophages to limit UPEC access to iron. I also found that both uninfected and UPEC-infected bladders contained dendritic cells that could phagocytose UPEC, particles/debris, and apoptotic cells via scavenger receptors. Moreover, bladder macrophages expressed scavenger receptors for the uptake of extracellular bacteria during the early innate immune cell response to UPEC infection, while expressing receptors for the clearance of bacteria, apoptotic cells, and particles during the tissue repair response that follows a UTI. Taken together, my work suggests that innate immune cell scavenger receptors may play a crucial role in maintaining bladder health in the absence of infection, clearing UPEC during a UTI, and promoting the tissue repair response that follows a UTI. Furthermore, modulating the host iron regulation response, and promoting macrophage inflammatory signaling, may provide an effective treatment for UTIs"
1,New roles of Rab GTPases on eye diseases: targeting VEGF secretion,https://core.ac.uk/works/46051851,"RESUMO: A retina é composta, entre outras estruturas, pelo epitélio pigmentar da retina (EPR)e pela coróide. A região central da retina denomina-se mácula, e é a zona mais afetada na degenerescência macular relacionada com a idade, a forma mais comum de degenerescência da retina. Nesta doença, a secreção de fatores de crescimento pelo EPR é afetada, nomeadamente a do fator de crescimento vascular endotelial (VEGF), e pouco se sabe ainda sobre os mecanismos moleculares conducentes a esta condição. A família de proteínas Rab GTPases está envolvida nas vias intracelulares de sinalização e tráfego membranares, essenciais na transdução de sinais extracelulares em respostas biológicas. A
sua crucial importância nestes mecanismos levou-nos a considerar o seu potencial
envolvimento nas vias de secreção do VEGF, e a questionar-nos se teriam algum papel
regulador sobre as mesmas. O principal objetivo deste trabalho é identificar Rab GTPases importantes para as vias de secreção e endocitose do VEGF no EPR. Essa identificação ajudará a esclarecer a patogénese da degenerescência macular da retina, e poderá servir para uma procura mais direcionada de novos agentes terapêuticos. A caracterização de dois
modelos in vitro do EPR, células primárias isoladas de murganho e a linha celular B6-RPE07,levou-nos a concluir que são ambos semelhantes. Contudo, a linha celular foi escolhida como protótipo do EPR por permitir o acesso a um número ilimitado de células. No decurso deste trabalho, desenvolvemos e caracterizámos uma biblioteca de ferramentas moleculares que nos permitiram reduzir os níveis proteicos das proteínas Rab GTPases, com base na tecnologia de ácido ribonucleico (ARN) de interferência. O papel das proteínas Rab GTPases na secreção do VEGF no EPR foi estudado com base no silenciamento de apenas uma proteína, ou combinando várias, segundo a sua localização e funções intracelulares descritas. Este trabalho permitiu-nos concluir que as proteínas Rab GTPases são importantes intervenientes no processo de secreção de VEGF pelo EPR, e confirmar dados anteriores que relatam o envolvimento de algumas Rab GTPases endocíticas no processo. Propomos ainda
um novo modelo para a interação destas proteínas no EPR, e sugerimos que a Rab10 e a
Rab14 atuam negativamente sobre a Rab8, controlando o seu funcionamento. Os nossos
resultados evidenciam a importância das proteínas Rab GTPases na secreção do VEGF pelas células do EPR, e servem de base a futuros estudos que melhor procurem compreender este mecanismo e de que modo a sua alteração se relaciona com a degenerescência da retina.--------ABSTRACT: Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid are components of the mammalian retina, of which the central region is called macula. The most common form of retinaldegeneration, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), involves primarily deregulation of
growth factors secretion by the RPE. Very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to impairment of RPE’s homeostatic intracellular processes, namely the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Rab GTPases’ family regulates membrane targeting and traffic, being essential in the transduction of signal pathways. Given Rab proteins’ role in intracellular trafficking, we propose to identify key regulatory Rab proteins
involved in either the secretory or the recycling pathways of VEGF in RPE. Understanding how Rab proteins’ function disruption could lead to retinal and choroidal pathology would ultimately contribute to find new therapeutic agents. Here, we characterized two mouse RPE
in vitro cell models, primary cells and B6-RPE07 cell line, and concluded that both display important epithelial features as the RPE presents in vivo. Considering unlimited cell number and results reproducibility, we chose B6-RPE07 cells to further study Rab proteins’ function.
To scrutinize the consequences of Rab proteins’ absence or diminished levels, we have developed novel molecular tools to achieve silencing of these key proteins using miRNA technology. We further addressed the effect of Rab proteins’ absence on VEGF secretion by performing an extensive screening where different Rab proteins were silenced, both individually and in multiple combinations considering their cellular/ compartment location.
We conclude that Rab GTPases are important intervenients in VEGF secretion by RPE cells,
confirming endocytic Rab proteins’ role in regulation of VEGF biology. We also propose a
novel model for Rab proteins’ interaction in RPE. Our results suggest that Rab10 and Rab14
might influence Rab8 in a negative feedback mechanism, important for controlling VEGF
secretion. Our achievements’ unravel Rab proteins’ role in VEGF secretion by RPE cells and are the basis for future studies to better understand RPE molecular secretory machinery"
2,Long noncoding RNAs are critical regulators of pancreatic islet development and function,https://core.ac.uk/works/46232628,"Diabetes is a complex group of metabolic disorders with genetic, immunological, and environmental etiologies. Decades of diabetes research have elucidated many genetic drivers of normal islet function and dysfunction. Furthermore, genome wide associated studies (GWAS) have discovered that most diabetes susceptibility loci fall outside of coding regions, which suggests a role for noncoding elements in the development of disease. This highlights our incomplete understanding of the islet regulome and suggests the need for detailed functional analyses of noncoding genes to precisely determine their contribution to diabetes susceptibility and disease progression. Transcriptome analyses have revealed that the eukaryotic genome is pervasively transcribed. Strikingly, only a small proportion of the transcriptome is subsequently translated into protein; the majority is made up non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The most abundant class of these ncRNAs are called long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that lack protein-coding potential. The establishment of lncRNAs, once dismissed as genomic dark matter, as essential gene regulators in many biological processes has redefined the central role for RNA in cells. While evidence suggests a role for lncRNAs in islets and diabetes, in vivo functional characterization of islet lncRNAs is lacking.
      For my thesis project, I sought to understand the lncRNA regulatory mechanisms that promote pancreas development and function. We conducted comparative transcriptome analyses between embryonic mouse pancreas and adult mouse islets and identified several pancreatic lncRNAs that lie in close proximity to essential pancreatic transcription factors. One of the candidate lncRNAs, Pax6 Upstream Antisense RNA (Paupar), mapped near Pax6, a gene encoding an essential pancreatic regulatory protein. We demonstrate Paupar is enriched in glucagon-producing alpha cells where it promotes the alternative splicing of Pax6 to an isoform required for activation of essential alpha cell genes. Consistently, deletion of Paupar in mice resulted in dysregulation of Pax6 alpha cell target genes and corresponding alpha cell dysfunction. These findings illustrate a distinct mechanism by which lncRNAs can contribute to cell-specific regulation of broadly expressed transcription factors to coordinate critical functions within a cell"
3,Defining the mechanisms of neutrophil exocytosis using proteomic techniques.,https://core.ac.uk/works/46387123,"Exocytosis of intracellular granules is critical for conversion of inactive, circulating neutrophils to fully activated cells. The p38 MAPK pathway plays a central role in neutrophil exocytosis, although its mechanism of action is unknown. We used several proteomic approaches to identify granule proteins and find targets of the p38 MAPK and its downstream kinase, MK2, on granules. Our analysis identified 286 proteins on neutrophil granules, four of which were known MK2 substrates. Known p38 substrates were not detected. However, MRP-14 was identified as a novel p38 MAPK substrate. MRP-14 was phosphorylated by p38 MAPK in neutrophils upon cell stimulation and translocated to plasma membranes and gelatinase granules, as well as to Triton X-100-insoluble structures at the base of lamellipodia. Phosphorylation of the MRP-14 by p38 MAPK increased binding to actin in vitro. These results suggest that MRP-14 is a potential mediator of p38 MAPK-dependent exocytosis in human neutrophils"

This bacterium, while most noted or the Black Death during the European 14th century, is not a historic pathogen but a re-emerging pandemic with both domestic and global impact. Y. pestis is capable of colonizing the macrophage, and actively subverts phagolysosome maturation to establish a replicative niche known as the Yersinia containing vacuole (YCV). The exploited host factors required to support the YCV are unknown. Here we identified a comprehensive list of host factors required for Y. pestis survival through a genome-wide RNAi high-throughput screen. We further identify that avoidance of the phagolysosome requires early recruitment of Rab1b and Rab4a on the YCV. Finally, we show that during intracellular infection Y. pestis sequesters Rab11b to the YCV to stall host cell recycling and support bacterial replication after 8 hours post-infection. These data identify the first host factors required for Y. pestis survival within the macrophage, avoidance of phagolysosome maturation, and a novel role for exploiting the host recycling pathway for bacterial replication"
5,ER to Golgi transport during apoptosis,https://core.ac.uk/works/8514275,"The  Golgi  complex, a single -copy organelle, is composed of a ribbon of flattened stacks of cisternae during interphase.   However, during apoptosis the  Golgi is shown to fragment and disperse  throughout the  cytoplasm. Immunoelectron   microscopy identified  these fragments as vesicular-tubular structures that  contained   the  Golgi marker n-acetyl-glucosaminyl-transferase-1. Newly-synthesised proteins translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum also failed to exit from this organelle and reach the  Golgi in apoptotic cells.Induction   of   apoptosis by Fas receptor ligation led to the caspase-dependent cleavage of  GM130, a key  Golgi-localised   protein  involved in tethering  incoming secretory vesicles to the cis -Golgi.   Cleavage  of  GM130 was prevented by the  broad-range protein  kinase  inhibitor  staurosporine,  suggesting  that  phosphorylation   played a role in the regulation of  GM130 activity during  apoptosis. These  morphological and functional changes to the early secretory  pathway during  apoptosis could  explain  the down-regulation of the  exocytic  pathway in apoptotic  neutrophils, which  may prevent the inappropriate release of proinflammatory agents    during resolution of inflammation"
6,"Armus dual roles in autophagy and E-cadherin degradation: distinct partners, regulation and implications for cancer patients",https://core.ac.uk/works/124858448,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Invasion, metastasis and apoptotic evasion are cancer hallmarks. Tumour cell metastasis requires loss of E-cadherin cell-cell adhesion receptor. Apoptotic evasion can be mediated by up-regulation of autophagy, which maintains cellular energy during metabolic stress in cancer cells. Armus is a TBC/RabGAP protein that regulates both E-cadherin degradation and autophagy by controlling lysosome fusion with late vesicular compartments or autophagosomes. Understanding Armus function in these degradative processes during tumourigenesis may lead to combinatorial inhibition of oncogenic pathways and novel therapeutic targets. Here I address: (i) whether Armus participates in E-cadherin deregulation downstream of oncogenes, (ii) potential mechanisms through which Armus can switch between its function at junctions and autophagosomes and (iii) potential strategies to inhibit Armus intracellular localisation. I found that Armus is involved in Src and H-Ras disruption of E-cadherin junctions in keratinocytes. Armus binds to α-catenin at junctions, while at autophagosomes Armus interacts with autophagy marker, LC3. Incubation with Armus peptides containing LC3-interacting motifs partially blocks Armus function in autophagy. Mutation of the specific residues mediating α-catenin association reduces Armus localisation at cell-cell contacts. The close juxtaposition of LC3 and α-catenin binding at PH domain at Armus N-terminus may suggest additional roles. Armus N-terminus and RabGAP domain interact directly, and residue K480 is critical for binding. This intramolecular interaction may form a closed conformation, and Armus activation may require the release of this auto-inhibition. It is tempting to suggest that protein interactions at the PH domain such as LC3 and α-catenin may modulate Armus auto-inhibition. Alternatively, the phosphoinositide repertoire interacting with the PH domain may contribute to Armus intracellular distribution and activation. Further insights into Armus activation may provide greater understanding of its function in distinct cellular events with implications for tumourigenesis.Open Acces"

A strategy to construct Einstein metrics consists on deforming a given metric by a conformal factor so that the resulting metric is Einstein. In the present Thesis we follow this approach with special emphasis in dimension four. This is the first non-trivial case where the conformally Einstein condition is not tensorial and there are topological obstructions to the existence of Einstein metrics.
 
The conformally Einstein condition is given by a overdetermined PDE-system. Hence the consideration of necessary conditions to be conformally Einstein are of special relevance: the Bach-flat condition is central.
 
In this Thesis we classify four-dimensional homogeneous conformally Einstein manifolds and provide a large family of strictly Bach-flat gradient Ricci solitons. We show the existence of Bach-flat structures given as deformations of Riemannian extensions by means of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem"
0,Obese Zucker Rats as a Reverse Translational Model of Human Left Ventricular Hypertrophy,https://core.ac.uk/works/107381910,"Heart failure is a lifelong disability that for over half of those affected leads to mortality within five years after initial diagnosis. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is one of the most reliable independent predictors of heart failure. Pathological LVH is irreversible, but early diagnosis is often missed due to its asymptomatic nature. Obese Zucker rats (OZR), which develop obesity due to dysfunctional leptin signaling, naturally exhibit a LVH that mimics the obese human condition. Animal models are necessary because human donor tissue is scarce. The central hypothesis is that genes and proteins that are differentially expressed during development of LVH, relative to sex and obesity status, will serve as clinical biomarkers or therapeutic targets for detection and prevention of heart failure. No previous studies have addressed LVH on an exome-wide basis. In the present research, I address these knowledge gaps with transcriptome analysis of rat and human left ventricles in a sex- and obesity-specific manner. Specific genes (NPPA, NPPB, HBB, MYL7, PDK4) known to be involved in cardiac development and function were then validated proteomically to form a LVH gene signature that may be useful for future diagnosis or represent targets for intervention. This work defines novel LVH transcriptomes in humans and OZR and these datasets allow for confirmation of whether an individual gene or geneset is translationally-relevant for further investigation in LVH. Future work should address transcriptomic and proteomic changes throughout LVH development and whether intervention targeting specific gene products can ameliorate onset of LVH"
1,LATE EVENTS OF HUMAN METAPNEUMOVIRUS INFECTION: INSIGHTS INTO VIRAL SPREAD WITHIN THE RESPIRATORY EPITHELIUM,https://core.ac.uk/works/69235336,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of respiratory tract infections worldwide across all age groups, and is particularly devastating in the pediatric, elderly and immunocompromised populations. Despite its high prevalence and burden on human health, there are currently no treatments or vaccines against HMPV infections. HMPV is an enveloped virus that belongs to the paramyxovirus family. Paramyxoviruses in general form by assembly of virus components at the plasma membrane followed by budding and release of virus particles into the extracellular matrix to spread infection. The process of forming new virus particles requires complex interactions between viral and cellular components and the requirements for particle production differ substantially among paramyxoviruses. Several key aspects of the life cycle of HMPV remain unknown. The work presented here provides significant advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying assembly and spread of HMPV in human bronchial airway epithelial cells. We provide evidence that HMPV induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules at late stages of infection leading to the formation of complex networks of branched filaments and intercellular extensions, structures that have not been previously reported for paramyxoviruses. Our results indicate a novel mode of HMPV spread directly from cell-to-cell across intercellular extensions. We identified an important role of actin and the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 in direct cell-to-cell spread of HMPV. While roles for paramyxovirus matrix and fusion proteins in membrane deformation have been previously demonstrated for several paramyxoviruses, we show that the HMPV phosphoprotein (P) associates with actin and induces formation of membrane extensions, suggesting a role for the P protein in HMPV exit from the cell. Additionally, infection of differentiated, polarized human airway tissues showed that release of HMPV particles at the apical side is inefficient and revealed that spread of HMPV in these tissues can occur in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. HMPV infection also resulted in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in these tissues mainly at the apical side. Collectively, the data provided in this dissertation reveal a novel mechanism by which HMPV uses the cytoskeleton for cell-to-cell transmission and provide critical insights into spread of respiratory viruses within the airway epithelium"
2,Effects of C-terminal truncations of the histone acetyltransferase p300 on the growth and gene expression patterns of human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines,https://core.ac.uk/works/46221762,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of non-Hodgkin’s B- cell lymphoma, accounting for about 30% of these lymphomas in the United States. Large-scale genome analyses of DLBCL have identified mutations in the related histone acetyltransferases (HATs) p300 and CBP in approximately 15% of patient samples and patient-derived cell lines. The research presented herein characterizes two human DLBCL cell lines, RC-K8 and SUDHL2, which express C-terminally truncated HAT domain-deficient p300 proteins, p300ΔC-1087 and p300 p300ΔC-820, respectively. It is shown that p300ΔC-820 localizes to sites of active transcription in the nucleus, interacts with NF-κB transcription factor REL, weakly enhances REL-dependent transactivation, and has a half-life similar to wild-type p300. Results demonstrate that knockdown of p300ΔC-820 in SUDHL2 cells reduces cell proliferation in vitro. In RC-K8 cells, p300ΔC-1087 suppresses expression of the NF-κB target genes A20 and IκBα, both of which are cytotoxic when overexpressed in RC-K8 cells. Microarray analysis of p300ΔC1087 knockdown compared to wild-type RC-K8 cells indicated that p300ΔC-1087 suppresses an NF-κB gene expression program and activates a MYC gene expression program in RC-K8 cells. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that cancer cell lines— regardless of tissue type—with truncating p300 mutations have altered expression of a MYC target gene set as compared to cancer cell lines with wild-type p300/CBP. Taken together, this research indicates that p300 truncations contribute to cell growth in DLBCL by modifying the transcriptional output of two lymphoid cell-specific oncoproteins, NF- κB and MYC, to optimal levels and suggests that p300 truncating mutations similarly modify the activity of oncogenic drivers in other cancer cell types. Based on this work, p300 truncation is proposed to represent a new class of oncogenic mutation that serves to optimize the activity of context-specific oncogenic transcription factors, and it is suggested that such oncogenic mutations be termed “cancer modifying” mutations.2017-09-30T00:00:00"
3,"A transcriptomic approach for studying the activation of

dendritic cells in response to mycobacterial infections",https://core.ac.uk/works/537996,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) is responsible for 2 million

deaths annually. In recent years co-infection with HIV and drug-resistant strains

has led to the increase in clinical cases of tuberculosis. BCG is the only vaccine

currently available but is ineffective against adult pulmonary forms of the disease.

Understanding the principle components of the host immune response against the

pathogen will aid in the design of a better vaccine. Dendritic cells are potent

antigen presenting cells that play a key role in priming naïve T cells. Effective T

cell priming is necessary for a successful protective immune response in the host

against the pathogen.



I have been investigating the interaction of dendritic cells with M.

tuberculosis, with a view to better understanding the signalling pathways affecting

priming of anti-mycobacterial T cells by dendritic cells. Using DNA microarray

and bio-informatics, I have been able to study early transcriptional signatures of

bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) in response to M. tuberculois

infection. Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs) and NFkB (Nuclear Factor kappa

B) appear to be the principal transcription factors involved in regulating the

cellular responses in M. tuberculosis infected BMDCs. It has been found that

IRFs can function independent of the adaptor MyD88 (Myeloid Differentiation

Factor 88) in M. tuberculosis infected BMDCs, which is surprising considering

the important role played by MyD88 in the Toll mediated signalling pathway. Exvivo

experiments also show that MyD88 may not be absolutely essential for

mounting anti-mycobacterial T cell responses. Hence immune responses

generated by M. tuberculosis infected BMDCs appear to be mediated via the

MyD88 dependent and independent pathways"

As meaningful biological understanding of the disease is confounded by the existence of various molecular groups and sub-groups, the challenge for targeted drug development may lie in understanding the molecular mechanisms of various sub-groups in breast cancer. 



An in-house breast cancer gene expression dataset comprising 17 normal and 104 tumour samples was analysed to identify important genes and pathways relevant to various clinical parameters. Our results identified groups of patients with similar expression profiles, the possible biology driving them and the clinical implications. Comparing Normal and Cancer specimens’ gene expression profiles, TP53, along with cell cycle genes, were up-regulated in cancer samples. Embryonic stem cell pathway genes were up-regulated, while fatty acid biosynthesis pathways were down-regulated in tumors vs normal. 



The cancer specimens largely clustered with respect to ER status. Meta-analysis was performed on in-house datasets along with five public datasets to identify ER pathway genes. The analysis identified novel genes which had not been previously associated with ER-related pathways in cancer. Nuclear receptor pathways were up-regulated in ER-positive tumors/cell lines. Mining for ESR1-correlated genes across 5897 specimens identified FOXA1, SPDEF, C1ORF34 and GATA3 expression to be highly correlated. 



Three sub-clusters were identified among the ER-negative cluster. One represented ERBB2 over-expressing cluster. Additionally two unique groups of patients, with significant differences in survival, previously un-identified by other studies, were identified among the ER-negative cluster; a good prognosis cluster with high expression of Immune response genes; and a bad prognosis cluster with high expression of Ropporin, over-expression of which was also linked to high incidence of relapse in our study. siRNA knockdown of Ropporin (ROPN1 and ROPN1B) in the M14 melanoma cell line impaired cancer cell motility and invasion. Knockdown of ROPN1B in MDA-MB-435s reduced motility. In the first study of its kind our results validated the role of Ropporin in cancer cell motility and invasion.



A list of 162 relapse-associated prognostically-important genes was used to develop a Neural Network back propagation model to predict the clinical outcomes. The model was successful in predicting relapse with 97.8% accuracy and outperformed existing models, indicating a strong possibility of its use as diagnostic model"
7,"Characterisation of high and low avidity peptide specific CD8+ T cells using immunologic, transcriptomic and proteomic tools",https://core.ac.uk/works/7794082,"One of the hallmarks of successful immunotherapy is the generation of high avidity cytotoxic T cells which can recognise and respond to very low concentration of antigens. This sensitivity of T cells is usually determined by peptide titration ELISpot assays. Even though these assays are generally useful, they are laborious and sample demanding. The assays become even more difficult if the peptide(s) accountable for the generation of vaccine specific responses are unknown such as whole protein or cell vaccines. Therefore, there is a need to identify markers which can quickly and reliably identify a high avidity T cell response in cancer vaccination settings. To achieve this goal, this study utilised a C57Bl/6J mouse model which could efficiently generate high and low avidity T cell responses, when immunisation was undertaken with two form of vaccines to deliver the target antigens. The antigenic epitopes used for this study were derived from TRP-2 ‘self’ and ovalbumin (OVA) ‘foreign’ antigens. Immunisation of animals with these antigens in a DNA vaccine format induces a high avidity T cell response, in contrast to the response when these are administered in the peptide vaccine format. However, both the immunisations produced same number of peptide specific CD8+ T cells, which was assessed my multimer staining. When these cells were subjected to in vitro stimulations with the target peptides, the functionality of the low avidity T cells was restored whereas the high avidity T cells failed to respond to lower peptide concentrations. This showed the plasticity of antigen specific T cells and their ability to modulate their functionality according to the stimulation they have received"

0,Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (4th edition),https://core.ac.uk/works/18687094,"This work was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences [GM131919].In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.PostprintPeer reviewe"

2,Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (3rd edition),https://core.ac.uk/works/54745431,"In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes.
For example, a key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process versus those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process including the amount and rate of cargo sequestered and degraded). In particular, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation must be differentiated from stimuli that increase autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (inmost higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. It is worth emphasizing here that lysosomal digestion is a stage of autophagy and evaluating its competence is a crucial part of the evaluation of autophagic flux, or complete autophagy.
Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. Along these lines, because of the potential for pleiotropic effects due to blocking autophagy through genetic manipulation, it is imperative to target by gene knockout or RNA interference more than one autophagyrelated protein. In addition, some individual Atg proteins, or groups of proteins, are involved in other cellular pathways implying that not all Atg proteins can be used as a specific marker for an autophagic process. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field"
3,Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (3rd edition),https://core.ac.uk/works/45056298,"Many researchers, especially those new to the field, need to determine which criteria are essential for demonstrating autophagy, either for the purposes of their own research, or in the capacity of a manuscript or grant review.1 Acceptable standards are an important issue, particularly considering that each of us may have his/her own opinion regarding the answer. Unfortunately, the answer is in part a “moving target” as the field evolves.2 This can be extremely frustrating for researchers who may think they have met those criteria, only to find out that the reviewers of their papers have different ideas. Conversely, as a reviewer, it is tiresome to raise the same objections repeatedly, wondering why researchers have not fulfilled some of the basic requirements for establishing the occurrence of an autophagic process. In addition, drugs that potentially modulate autophagy are increasingly being used in clinical trials, and screens are being carried out for new drugs that can modulate autophagy for therapeutic purposes. Clearly it is important to determine whether these drugs are truly affecting autophagy, and which step(s) of the process is affected, based on a set of accepted criteria. Accordingly, we describe here a basic set of contemporary guidelines that can be used by researchers to plan and interpret their experiments, by clinicians to evaluate the literature with regard to autophagy-modulating therapies, and by both authors and reviewers to justify or criticize an experimental approach"
4,Proteomic identification of posttranslational modifications: cAMP-induced changes of phosphorylation and investigation of novel approaches detecting posttranslational modifications at lysine and arginine residues,https://core.ac.uk/works/85797510,"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an important second messenger which can be generated in response to signals binding to stimulatory G-protein coupled receptors. Inside the cell, protein kinase A is a well-known cAMP sensor. Within the present study, cAMP-dependent changes in the phosphorylation (phospho) pattern of lysosomal membrane and lysosome-associated proteins were investigated. The serine phospho-site at position 133 (S133) of the lysosome-associated SNARE-associated protein (SNAPIN) was found to be significantly downregulated in the phosphoproteomic data set of the lysosomal membrane fraction after elevating the intracellular cAMP level by a Forskolin/dibutyryl-cAMP (FSK/db-cAMP) treatment. In addition to that, a tendency of SNAPIN to dissociate from the lysosomes upon elevated cAMP levels was observed. Therefore, the cAMP-dependent downregulation of the S133 phospho-site detected in the MS-based approach could have also been caused by a translocation of SNAPIN after FSK/db-cAMP treatment. Nevertheless, a dephosphorylation of SNAPIN was observed in 2D-gelelectrophoresis of whole cell protein lysate after elevating the intracellular cAMP level. This observation confirmed the findings of the phosphoproteomic study although the dephosphorylation site could not be mapped to a specific amino acid position by 2D-gelelectrophoresis. Pull-down assays with a phosphomimetic proteoform of the S133 phospho-site (S133E) indicate an interaction of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 subunit 6 (BLOC1S6) with the S133E but not the S133A SNAPIN isoform (serine to alanine substitution mimics unphosphorylated SNAPIN at position 133). Furthermore, SNAPIN knock-out (KO) was associated with decreased endocytosis and increased exocytosis of lysosomal hydrolases compared to wildtype cells. Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels neither influenced these processes in wildtype nor in SNAPIN KO cells. This indicates that the dephosphorylation of SNAPIN detected after FSK/db-cAMP treatment might not be involved in regulating these secretion or uptake events. Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of lysine and arginine residues are important regulators in different cellular processes. In bottom-up mass spectrometry-based approaches, these PTMs are most commonly enriched with pan-specific antibodies. Here, the investigations are limited to one specific PTM and depend on the quality and availability of proper antibodies in order to obtain an efficient enrichment of modified peptides. In addition to that, huge amounts of samples are usually required in these immunoprecipitation approaches which might be problematic when dealing with limited amounts of starting material. The present study aimed at developing and testing of two novel antibody-free techniques for improving the detection of specific PTMs from small quantities of starting sample. For example, such techniques would facilitate PTM analysis of enriched lysosomes or other purified subcellular compartments. The first technique, called the serial digestion workflow, was assumed to enhance the identification of lysine modifications. Compared to that, the second method, called the Nα-selective derivatization workflow (derivatization of primary amine group at amino-terminus), was hypothesized to improve the detection of PTMs occurring on both, lysine and arginine residues. Applying the two workflows to proteins from human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cell lysate was not associated with an increased identification of lysine modifications. In contrast, sample treatment according to the Nα-selective derivatization method yielded an increase in the detection rate of arginine methylation. However, a similar rise was observed in both workflows after strong cation exchange chromatography which was originally performed as a sample clean-up procedure. Here, depending on the sample type, either the identification of arginine or of lysine and arginine methylation was increased. Comparison of the methylated peptides detected in the different samples showed only a partial overlap. This indicates the necessity of analyzing different samples coming from both workflows in order to get the most comprehensive protein methylation data set. Based on these findings, a new hybrid workflow is suggested"
5,Computational and Biological Approaches for Identification of Hedgehog Signaling Targets and Their Application to Intestinal Visceral Smooth Muscle Development in the Mouse.,https://core.ac.uk/works/37680585,"The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is an evolutionarily conserved cell-cell signaling pathway that controls organ development and homeostasis in embryos and adults. Hh signaling functions in cell fate choice, patterning, cell survival, proliferation and/or differentiation. Several birth defects are known to result from altered Hh signaling and aberrant Hh signaling is also responsible for several cancers. Despite its central role in development and disease, very little is known about the precise genetic targets of Hh signaling or the genomic enhancers that activate those genes. These target genes and associated Hh-responsive enhancers are themselves responsible for disease initiation and progression. A comprehensive effort to identify these signaling targets and to dissect the context specificity that underlies their expression is therefore a high priority. This work was driven by two Aims: 1) to explore novel computational approaches for the identification of Hh-responsive enhancers; and 2) to understand the contribution of Hh-driven gene expression in the context of a single Hh-responsive cell type, intestinal visceral smooth muscle (ISM). 
This work comprised a multi-pronged approach, integrating both computational and biological methods in parallel, to achieve these Aims. First, we explored the degree to which clustered binding sites for the Hh transcription factor, ci/GLI, would predict functional enhancers. While this method was somewhat successful in the fly, it could not be applied to the mouse, where Hh enhancers tend not to be homotypically clustered. Therefore, a machine learning strategy was explored with substantial success, resulting in the identification of seven 
new enhancers in genes encoding Hh pathway components. Finally, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data were collected to generate a catalog of smooth muscle genes that are expressed in a specific layer of developing intestinal smooth muscle. Analysis of this data implicated cJUN as a regulatory component in ISM formation and established Hh as an upstream regulator of cJun expression in that tissue. 
Though this work has focused on Hh signaling, a similar approach could be applied to any transcription factor or signaling pathway to comprehensively analyze the gene regulatory networks governing many normal and disease-related cell states.PHDBioinformaticsUniversity of Michigan, Horace H.

We have employed a label‐free proteomic approach that allows quantification of large numbers of brain‐expressed proteins in a single analysis in the mouse (male C57BL/6J) kainate (KA) model of epileptogenesis. In addition, we have incorporated two putative antiepileptogenic drugs, postsynaptic density protein‐95 blocking peptide (PSD95BP or Tat‐NR2B9c) and a highly selective inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 1400W, to give an insight into how such agents might ameliorate epileptogenesis. The test drugs were administered after the induction of status epilepticus (SE) and the animals were euthanized at 7 days, their hippocampi removed, and subjected to LC‐MS/MS analysis. A total of 2,579 proteins were identified; their normalized abundance was compared between treatment groups using ANOVA, with correction for multiple testing by false discovery rate. Significantly altered proteins were subjected to gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. KA‐induced SE was most robustly associated with an alteration in the abundance of proteins involved in neuroinflammation, including heat shock protein beta‐1 (HSP27), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and CD44 antigen. Treatment with PSD95BP or 1400W moderated the abundance of several of these proteins plus that of secretogranin and Src substrate cortactin. Pathway analysis identified the glutamatergic synapse as a key target for both drugs. Our observations require validation in a larger‐scale investigation, with candidate proteins explored in more detail. Nevertheless, this study has identified several mechanisms by which epilepsy might develop and several targets for novel drug development"
8,Molecular Landscape of Induced Reprogramming: A Dissertation,https://core.ac.uk/works/31512596,"Recent breakthroughs in creating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) provide alternative means to obtain embryonic stem (ES) cell-like cells without destroying embryos by introducing four reprogramming factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4/c-Myc or Nanog/Lin28) into somatic cells. However, the molecular basis of reprogramming is largely unknown. To address this question, we employed microRNAs, small molecules, and conducted genome-wide RNAi screen, to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of reprogramming.
First we showed that depleting miR-21 and miR-29a enhances reprogramming in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We also showed that p53 and ERK1/2 pathways are regulated by miR-21 and miR-29a and function in reprogramming.
Second, we showed that computational chemical biology combined with genomic analysis can be used to identify small molecules regulating reprogramming. We discovered that the NSAID Nabumetone and the anti-cancer drug OHTM could replace Sox2 during reprogramming. Nabumetone could also replace c-Myc or Sox2 without compromising self-renewal and pluripotency of derived iPS cells.
To identify the cell-fate determinants during reprogramming, we integrated a genome-wide RNAi screen with transcriptome analysis to dissect the molecular requirements in reprogramming. We found that extensive interactions of embryonic stem cell core circuitry regulators are established in mature iPS cells, including Utf1, Nr6a1, Tdgf1, Gsc, Fgf10, T, Chrd, Dppa3, Fgf17, Eomes, Foxa2. Remarkably, genes with non-differential change play the most critical roles in the transitions of reprogramming. Functional validation showed that some genes act as essential or barrier roles to reprogramming. We also identified several genes required for maintaining ES cell properties. Altogether, our results demonstrate the significance of miRNA function in regulating multiple signaling networks involved in reprogramming. And our work further advanced the reprogramming field by identifying several new key modulators"
9,Characterization of microRNA-Protein Interactions and Genome-Scale Screening for Modifiers of LDL Cholesterol Uptake,https://core.ac.uk/works/89412582,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate protein expression via post-transcriptional silencing of target genes. These small RNAs are implicated in the regulation of nearly all biological processes, and global miR biogenesis is altered in many cancers. Additionally, miRNA-binding proteins have been shown to modulate miR biogenesis, presenting a promising avenue for targeting miRNA dysregulation in disease. Herein, high-throughput screening and proteomics-mediated approaches are used for small molecule targeting and novel characterization of miRNA–protein interactions, respectively. These works culminated in the discovery of SART3 as a pre-miR-34a–binding protein whose overexpression leads to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, as described in Chapter 2, as well as the establishment of the first complementation assay for high throughput screening of RNA–protein interactions, as described in Chapter 3. 
In a second project, regulators of cholesterol-carrying low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake are interrogated in liver cells. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States, and high LDL cholesterol is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Mechanisms outside of LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis are poorly understood; to address this gap, a series of functional genomic CRISPR screens are conducted to identify genetic modulators of LDL uptake in hepatocytes. As described in Chapter 5, these studies identified ~150 previously unrecognized genes with putative roles in LDL uptake. Additionally, secondary screens for transferrin uptake, LDL receptor abundance, and LDL uptake in HepG2 cells and LDLR-deleted cells gave mechanistic insights related to the specificity, generalizability, and LDLR-dependence of these gene candidates. Furthermore, these results highlighted the statistical power of using focused secondary libraries with greater depth to follow up on genome-wide screens.PHDChemical BiologyUniversity of Michigan, Horace H.
