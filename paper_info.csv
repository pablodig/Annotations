0,The late endocytic Rab39a GTPase regulates the interaction between multivesicular bodies and chlamydial inclusions.,https://core.ac.uk/works/40912718,"Given their obligate intracellular lifestyle, Chlamydia trachomatis ensure their access to multiple host sources of essential lipids by interfering vesicular transport. These bacteria hijack Rab6-, Rab11- and Rab14-controlled trafficking pathways to acquire sphingomyelin from the Golgi apparatus. Another important source of sphingolipids, phospholipids and cholesterol are multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Despite their participation in chlamydial inclusion development and bacterial replication, the molecular mechanisms mediating MVBs-inclusion interaction remain unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that Rab39a labels a subset of late endocytic vesicles -mainly MVBs- that move along microtubules. Moreover, Rab39a is actively recruited to chlamydial inclusions throughout the pathogen life cycle by a bacterial-driven process and depending on its GTP/GDP binding state. Interestingly, Rab39a participates in the delivery of MVB and host sphingolipids to maturing chlamydial inclusions thereby promoting inclusion growth and bacterial development. Altogether, our findings indicate that Rab39a favours chlamydial replication and infectivity. This is the first report showing a late endocytic Rab GTPase involved in chlamydial infection development.Fil: Gambarte Tudela, Julian Alberto.

1,Twist1 Directly Regulates Genes That Promote Cell Proliferation and Migration in Developing Heart Valves,https://core.ac.uk/works/4005785,"Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is expressed in mesenchymal precursor populations during embryogenesis and in metastatic cancer cells. In the developing heart, Twist1 is highly expressed in endocardial cushion (ECC) valve mesenchymal cells and is down regulated during valve differentiation and remodeling. Previous studies demonstrated that Twist1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and expression of primitive extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules in ECC mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, Twist1 expression is induced in human pediatric and adult diseased heart valves. However, the Twist1 downstream target genes that mediate increased cell proliferation and migration during early heart valve development remain largely unknown. Candidate gene and global gene profiling approaches were used to identify transcriptional targets of Twist1 during heart valve development. Candidate target genes were analyzed for evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) containing E-box consensus sequences that are potential Twist1 binding sites. ECRs containing conserved E-box sequences were identified for Twist1 responsive genes Tbx20, Cdh11, Sema3C, Rab39b, and Gadd45a. Twist1 binding to these sequences in vivo was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and binding was detected in ECCs but not late stage remodeling valves. In addition identified Twist1 target genes are highly expressed in ECCs and have reduced expression during heart valve remodeling in vivo, which is consistent with the expression pattern of Twist1. Together these analyses identify multiple new genes involved in cell proliferation and migration that are differentially expressed in the developing heart valves, are responsive to Twist1 transcriptional function, and contain Twist1-responsive regulatory sequences"
2,Rab39a and Rab39b display different intracellular distribution and function in sphingolipids and phospholipids transport,https://core.ac.uk/works/41052356,"Rab GTPases define the identity and destiny of vesicles. Some of these small GTPases present isoforms that are expressed differentially along developmental stages or in a tissue-specific manner, hence comparative analysis is difficult to achieve. Here, we describe the intracellular distribution and function in lipid transport of the poorly characterized Rab39 isoforms using typical cell biology experimental tools and new ones developed in our laboratory. We show that, despite their amino acid sequence similarity, Rab39a and Rab39b display non-overlapping intracellular distribution. Rab39a localizes in the late endocytic pathway, mainly at multivesicular bodies. In contrast, Rab39b distributes in the secretory network, at the endoplasmic reticulum/cis-Golgi interface. Therefore, Rab39a controls trafficking of lipids (sphingomyelin and phospholipids) segregated at multivesicular bodies, whereas Rab39b transports sphingolipids biosynthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi factory. Interestingly, lyso bis-phosphatidic acid is exclusively transported by Rab39a, indicating that both isoforms do not exert identical functions in lipid transport. Conveniently, the requirement of eukaryotic lipids by the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis rendered useful for dissecting and distinguishing Rab39a-and Rab39b-controlled trafficking pathways. Our findings provide comparative insights about the different subcellular distribution and function in lipid transport of the two Rab39 isoforms.Fil: Gambarte Tudela, Julian Alberto.

4,GM-CSF Signalling Boosts Dramatically IL-1Production,https://core.ac.uk/works/3954955,"GM-CSF is mostly known for its capacity to promote bone marrow progenitor differentiation, to mobilize and mature myeloid cells as well as to enhance host immune responses. However the molecular actions of GM-CSF are still poorly characterized. Here we describe a new surprising facet of this “old” growth factor as a key regulator involved in IL-1βsecretion. We found that IL-1β release, a pivotal component of the triggered innate system, is heavily dependent on the signaling induced by GM-CSF in such an extent that in its absence IL-1β is only weakly secreted. GM-CSF synergizes with LPS for IL-1β secretion mainly at the level of pro-IL-1β production via strengthening the NF-κB signaling. In addition, we show that expression of Rab39a, a GTPase required for caspase-1 dependent IL-1β secretion is greatly augmented by LPS and GM-CSF co-stimulation suggesting a potential GM-CSF contribution in enhancing IL-1β exocytosis. The role of GM-CSF in regulating IL-1β secretion is extended also in vivo, since GM-CSF R−/− mice are more resistant to LPS-mediated septic shock. These results identify GM-CSF as a key regulator of IL-1β production and indicate GM-CSF as a previously underestimated target for therapeutic intervention"
5,9q21.13q21.31 deletion in a patient with intellectual disability severe speech delay and and dysmorphic features a newly recognized microdeletion syndrome,https://core.ac.uk/works/45385028,"The increased use of chromosomal microarray analysis has led to the identification of new microdeletion/microduplication syndromes,
enabling better genotype-phenotype correlations.
Interstitial deletions involving the long arm of chromosome 9 are rare but recently a microdeletion syndrome at 9q21.13 was suggested, with mental retardation, speech delay, epilepsy, autistic behaviour and moderate facial dysmorphism as the main characteristics.
Here we present a male child with intellectual disability, severe speech delay, microcephaly and dysmorphic features carrying an interstitial deletion, detected by the Affymetrix Cytoscan HD microarray, of 6.56 Mb at 9q21.13q21.31 region encompassing 16 OMIM genes (arr[GRCh37] 9q21.13q21.31(76551542_83116342)x1).
Among the genes in the deleted region the PRUNE2, PCSK5, RORB and TRPM6 genes are expressed in the nervous system and have been describe as being candidate genes to play a role in mental retardation or neurological disorders. Although the cohort of patients identified with deletions in this region is still small our patient phenotype partially overlaps the others described in the literature.
The collection of more cases with deletion of the 9q21.13 region will help establishing a clear classification for this CNV, finding the real weight in the patient’s phenotype, delineating the genetic counseling for their families, and clearly establishing this microdeletion as a syndrome.N/"
6,Identification and Characterization of Rab39a and Its Role in Crosspresentation,https://core.ac.uk/works/41685815,"Crosspresentation allows antigen presenting cells to present peptides from exogenously derived antigens onto MHC Class I for presentation to CD8+ T cells. Though this pathway shares key players with the Classical Class I and Class II pathways, several questions remain. A genomewide siRNA screen was performed to look for genes that selectively affected the crosspresentation or the Class II pathways. Among the genes identified in the screen was the Rab GTPase Rab39a. Rab39a was required for efficient crosspresentation but was dispensable for the presentation of endogenously expressed antigen. Both TAP-dependent and independent antigen required Rab39a for efficient presentation. Rab39a localized to late endosomes and phagosomes, though interestingly it was not required for the Class II pathway. Analysis of phagosomes from Rab39a KO or rescued cells has shown that in the presence of Rab39a, phagosomes were enriched for the open form of MHC Class I as well as TAP1, a member of the peptide loading complex. The enriched open form of MHC-I was peptide receptive, suggesting that it could contribute to crosspresentation. Phagosomes from Rab39a positive cells had reduced degradative capability and had increased levels of Sec22b, a SNARE protein reported to deliver ER-golgi sourced cargo to phagosomes. Furthermore, inhibition of ER-golgi transport via brefeldin A abolished the phenotype conferred by Rab39a. Thus, we hypothesize that Rab39a mediates the delivery of ER-golgi derived cargo to the antigen containing phagosome. This delivery allows peptide receptive MHC-I, as well as the peptide loading complex to reach the antigen, thereby facilitating crosspresentation"
7,"Cystatin A, a Potential Common Link for Mutant Myocilin Causative Glaucoma",https://core.ac.uk/works/4057832,"Myocilin (MYOC) is a 504 aa secreted glycoprotein induced by stress factors in the trabecular meshwork tissue of the eye, where it was discovered. Mutations in MYOC are linked to glaucoma. The glaucoma phenotype of each of the different MYOC mutation varies, but all of them cause elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). In cells, forty percent of wild-type MYOC is cleaved by calpain II, a cysteine protease. This proteolytic process is inhibited by MYOC mutants. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which MYOC mutants cause glaucoma. We constructed adenoviral vectors with variants Q368X, R342K, D380N, K423E, and overexpressed them in human trabecular meshwork cells. We analyzed expression profiles with Affymetrix U133Plus2 GeneChips using wild-type and null viruses as controls. Analysis of trabecular meshwork relevant mechanisms showed that the unfolded protein response (UPR) was the most affected. Search for individual candidate genes revealed that genes that have been historically connected to trabecular meshwork physiology and pathology were altered by the MYOC mutants. Some of those had known MYOC associations (MMP1, PDIA4, CALR, SFPR1) while others did not (EDN1, MGP, IGF1, TAC1). Some, were top-changed in only one mutant (LOXL1, CYP1B1, FBN1), others followed a mutant group pattern. Some of the genes were new (RAB39B, STC1, CXCL12, CSTA). In particular, one selected gene, the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin A (CSTA), was commonly induced by all mutants and not by the wild-type. Subsequent functional analysis of the selected gene showed that CSTA was able to reduce wild-type MYOC cleavage in primary trabecular meshwork cells while an inactive mutated CSTA was not. These findings provide a new molecular understanding of the mechanisms of MYOC-causative glaucoma and reveal CSTA, a serum biomarker for cancer, as a potential biomarker and drug for the treatment of MYOC-induced glaucoma"
8,Small GTPases of the Rab and Arf Families: Key Regulators of Intracellular Trafficking in Neurodegeneration,https://core.ac.uk/works/112784693,"Small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) of the Rab and Arf families are key regulators of vesicle formation and membrane trafficking. Membrane transport plays an important role in the central nervous system. In this regard, neurons require a constant flow of membranes for the correct distribution of receptors, for the precise composition of proteins and organelles in dendrites and axons, for the continuous exocytosis/endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and for the elimination of dysfunctional proteins. Thus, it is not surprising that Rab and Arf GTPases have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Both pathologies share characteristics such as the presence of protein aggregates and/or the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, hallmarks that have been related to both Rab and Arf GTPases functions. Despite their relationship with neurodegenerative disorders, very few studies have focused on the role of these GTPases in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. In this review, we summarize their importance in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, as well as their emergence as potential therapeutical targets for neurodegeneration.A.A.S. is a recipient of a predoctoral fellowship (PRE_2017_1_0016) from the Basque Government.

0,Critical role of CDKL5 in AMPA receptor composition: underlying mechanism and functional outcome.,https://core.ac.uk/works/37711446,"Neurological disorders associated with the X-linked kinase CDKL5 are characterized by the early onset of seizures, severe cognitive deficits and autistic traits. Loss of Cdkl5 affects spine density and stabilization as well as synaptic activity, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still far from fully understood. Here we show several pieces of evidence linking Cdkl5-associated synaptic defects to AMPA receptor (R) expression and subunit composition. In particular, primary hippocampal neurons devoid of Cdkl5 have defective GluA2-subunit expression, as well as a hyper-phosphorylation of Serine 880 (S880). Moreover, Cdkl5-downregulation skews the composition of membrane-inserted AMPARs towards the GluA2-depleted calcium-permeable form. The depletion of membrane-inserted GluA2 is likely to rely on defective recycling. Indeed, at the molecular level, we find that CDKL5 interacts with GRASP-1, a neuron-enriched protein that coordinates the endosomal sorting of AMPARs towards the plasma membrane. Against this background, we assume that the resulting alterations can underlie, at least in part, the synaptic dysfunctions and cognitive deficits in CDKL5 disorder. Finally, we provide evidence that tianeptine, a promising drug previously reported to modulate AMPAR-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission, is capable of restoring GluA2 expression and S880 phosphorylation in neurons devoid of CDKL5. These results places tianeptine as an interesting candidate drug for CDKL5-disorder"
1,Vesicular dysfunction and the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease: clues from genetic studies,https://core.ac.uk/works/8259319,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder with disabling motor symptoms and no available disease modifying treatment. The majority of the PD cases are of unknown aetiology, with both genetics and environment playing important roles. Over the past 25 years, however, genetic analysis of patients with familial history of Parkinson’s and, latterly, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have provided significant advances in our understanding of the causes of the disease. These genetic insights have uncovered pathways that are affected in both genetic and sporadic forms of PD. These pathways involve oxidative stress, abnormal protein homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lysosomal defects. In addition, newly identified PD genes and GWAS nominated genes point towards synaptic changes involving vesicles. This review will highlight the genes that contribute PD risk relating to intracellular vesicle trafficking and their functional consequences. There is still much to investigate on this newly identified and converging pathway of vesicular dynamics and PD, which will aid in better understanding and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for PD patients"
2,"High-Throughput Analysis of Promoter Occupancy Reveals New Targets for Arx, a Gene Mutated in Mental Retardation and Interneuronopathies",https://core.ac.uk/works/3969931,"Genetic investigations of X-linked intellectual disabilities have implicated the ARX (Aristaless-related homeobox) gene in a wide spectrum of disorders extending from phenotypes characterised by severe neuronal migration defects such as lissencephaly, to mild or moderate forms of mental retardation without apparent brain abnormalities but with associated features of dystonia and epilepsy. Analysis of Arx spatio-temporal localisation profile in mouse revealed expression in telencephalic structures, mainly restricted to populations of GABAergic neurons at all stages of development. Furthermore, studies of the effects of ARX loss of function in humans and animal models revealed varying defects, suggesting multiple roles of this gene during brain development. However, to date, little is known about how ARX functions as a transcription factor and the nature of its targets. To better understand its role, we combined chromatin immunoprecipitation and mRNA expression with microarray analysis and identified a total of 1006 gene promoters bound by Arx in transfected neuroblastoma (N2a) cells and in mouse embryonic brain. Approximately 24% of Arx-bound genes were found to show expression changes following Arx overexpression or knock-down. Several of the Arx target genes we identified are known to be important for a variety of functions in brain development and some of them suggest new functions for Arx. Overall, these results identified multiple new candidate targets for Arx and should help to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of intellectual disability and epilepsy associated with ARX mutations"
3,Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying alpha-synuclein oligomerization and cytotoxicity,https://core.ac.uk/works/40589676,"Tese de doutoramento, Ciências Biomédicas (Neurociências), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Medicina, 2017Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are proteinopathies characterized by the accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins. Either through loss of normal protein function and the generation of abnormal protein interactions, the protein network deteriorates inside neurons and subsequently along the neuronal networks. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most frequent ND and is associated with the misfolding and aggregation of alpha-Synuclein (aSyn), a pre-synaptic protein whose function is still unclear. Importantly, aSyn dysregulation is also involved in other NDs, as Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Multiple System Atrophy, jointly referred to as Synucleinopathies. Thus, the study of aSyn became crucial for understanding the etiology of those pathologies. There is ample debate as to what the toxic species of aSyn are, although it has been postulated that misfolded oligomeric species of aSyn represent the toxic genus. This thesis aimed to generate new insights into the role of aSyn in health and disease, at a molecular level. To visualize aSyn in the biological orchestra of the cell, we first studied its intracellular dynamics in a cellular model through photoactivation microscopy. Using photoactivatable green fluorescent protein as a reporter, we found that the availability of the aSyn amino-terminus modulates its shuttling into the nucleus. This finding has important implications regarding both the species of aSyn that enter the nucleus and also the function of the protein within that compartment. aSyn was recently suggested to exist naturally as a tetramer. Due to the nuclear pore size, only monomeric or dimeric forms of aSyn can enter the nucleus, and this has been related to a deleterious effect and neurotoxicity, due to transcription deregulation. Interestingly, intracellular dynamics of aSyn was finely modulated by the HSP70 chaperone, PD-associated mutations and by the phosphorylation state of the protein on S129 site. We found that the molecular chaperone HSP70 accelerates the entry of aSyn into the nuclear compartment. Also, A30P and A53T aSyn mutations increased the speed at which the protein moves between the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. Finally, specific kinases potentiate the shuttling of aSyn between nucleus and cytoplasm. Importantly, a mutant aSyn form that blocks S129 phosphorylation, S129A, results in the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions, suggesting that phosphorylation modulates aggregation, and thus, alter the normal aSyn intracellular dynamics. To better understand the aggregation process in disease, we focused on the initial steps of aSyn aggregation, thought to be the causative agents of pathology. We used cell-based models of Synucleinopathy to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying aSyn oligomerization. In particular, we screened, in an unbiased manner, a subset of the human genome-wide collection of lentiviral RNA-interference constructs, targeting genes involved in signal transduction players, to identify modifiers of aSyn oligomerization, using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (BiFC) as readout. Through this approach we identified 9 genetic modifiers of aSyn oligomerization. Interestingly, the hits we identified were functionally related, and associated with neuronal trafficking processes. We then characterized these hits with respect to their effects on aSyn aggregation, toxicity and protein levels. After this first level of general characterization, we further investigated the mechanism of action of the hits by assessing their effects on aSyn secretion, a central aspect in the spreading of aSyn pathology. aSyn is secreted under physiological conditions, via non-classical exocytosis, in association with exosomes, and possibly via other less conventional mechanisms. However, it was demonstrated that pathological and aggregated aSyn species can also be secreted, suggesting that aggregated and misfolded aSyn may be the key agent for propagation of aSyn pathology, possibly in a prion-like manner. Thus, in our study we selected four trafficking hits, based on the literature and on their relevance to secretory pathways. Ras-related Protein in Brain 8b (Rab8b), Rab11a, Rab13 and Synaptotagmin-Like Protein 5 were found to promote the clearance of aSyn inclusions and reduce aSyn toxicity. Moreover, we found that endocytic recycling and secretion of aSyn was enhanced upon expression of Rab11a or Rab13 in cells accumulating aSyn inclusions. Importantly, in cells with inclusions, the trafficking proteins co-localized with aSyn in inclusions. Altogether, our findings suggest specific trafficking steps may prove beneficial as targets for therapeutic intervention in Synucleinopathies, and should be further investigated in other models. Here, we also studied the effects of monoclonal aSyn antibodies on the early stages of aggregation using the BiFC assay. Our results support passive immunization against Synucleinopathies by demonstrating that extracellular administration of monoclonal antibodies can inhibit early steps in the aggregation process of aSyn. As aSyn seems to behave as a prion-like protein, immunization can be a mid-term strategy to delay the progression of Synucleinopathies. The present study uncovered novel aspects about the intracellular dynamics of aSyn and allowed the identification of new genetic players involved in the aggregation, toxicity, secretion and immunization of aSyn, opening novel avenues towards the understanding of the molecular bases of Synucleinopathies.Axa Research Fun"
4,Functional characterization of rare RAB12 variants and their role in musician’s and other dystonias,https://core.ac.uk/works/25816140,"Mutations in RAB (member of the Ras superfamily) genes are increasingly recognized as cause of a variety of disorders including neurological conditions. While musician’s dystonia (MD) and writer’s dystonia (WD) are task-specific movement disorders, other dystonias persistently affect postures as in cervical dystonia. Little is known about the underlying etiology. Next-generation sequencing revealed a rare missense variant (c.586A>G; p.Ile196Val) in RAB12 in two of three MD/WD families. Next, we tested 916 additional dystonia patients; 512 Parkinson’s disease patients; and 461 healthy controls for RAB12 variants and identified 10 additional carriers of rare missense changes among dystonia patients (1.1%) but only one carrier in non-dystonic individuals (0.1%; p = 0.005). The detected variants among index patients comprised p.Ile196Val (n = 6); p.Ala174Thr (n = 3); p.Gly13Asp; p.Ala148Thr; and p.Arg181Gln in patients with MD; cervical dystonia; or WD. Two relatives of MD patients with WD also carried p.Ile196Val. The two variants identified in MD patients (p.Ile196Val; p.Gly13Asp) were characterized on endogenous levels in patient-derived fibroblasts and in two RAB12-overexpressing cell models. The ability to hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP), so called GTPase activity, was increased in mutants compared to wildtype. Furthermore, subcellular distribution of RAB12 in mutants was altered in fibroblasts. Soluble Transferrin receptor 1 levels were reduced in the blood of all three tested p.Ile196Val carriers. In conclusion, we demonstrate an enrichment of missense changes among dystonia patients. Functional characterization revealed altered enzyme activity and lysosomal distribution in mutants suggesting a contribution of RAB12 variants to MD and other dystonias"
5,Ampa Receptor Dysregulation And Therapeutic Interventions In A Mouse Model Of Cdkl5 Deficiency Disorder,https://core.ac.uk/works/19090323,"CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD) is a rare disease that presents as a set of neurological deficits including early-life epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autistic-like behaviors. It results from pathogenic mutations in the gene for cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), a protein that is highly expressed in brain. There is no cure for CDD and seizures in this disorder are typically resistant to traditional anti-epileptic drugs, although some patients respond well to cannabidiol. However, underlying mechanisms of what causes hyperexcitability and neurological deficits in CDD is poorly understood. We investigated the novel Cdkl5R59X mouse (R59X), and observed that mutant mice have social interaction and memory deficits, and decreased latency to seizure after administration of pentylenetetrazol. Given the observed behavioral alterations and hyperexcitability in R59X mice, we hypothesized that mutant mice would exhibit underlying molecular and functional alterations in proteins involved in regulating the E:I balance. Indeed, we observed a specific decrease in membrane-bound AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA2 as well as decreased GluA2:GluA1 in the hippocampus of R59X mice, suggesting an increase in hippocampal GluA2-lacking AMPARs, which are calcium permeable and have significant roles in regulating neuronal plasticity and excitability. Indeed, decreased hippocampal GluA2 was accompanied by inward rectification of AMPAR currents in whole-cell patch recordings from hippocampal CA1 neurons, indicative of an increased population of functional GluA2-lacking AMPARs, and elevated early-phase long-term potentiation at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. Finally, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of GluA2-lacking AMPAR blocker IEM-1460 as well as cannabidiol to observe 1) whether blocking increased hippocampal GluA2-lacking AMPARs would attenuate behavioral alterations and hyperexcitability in R59X mice and 2) whether cannabidiol shows therapeutic efficacy in R59X mice similar to human CDD patients, thus validating R59X mice as a relevant model to test potential therapeutics in CDD. Indeed, IEM-1460 significantly rescued deficits in social behavior, short-term memory, and latency to seizure while cannabidiol significantly rescued deficits in short and long-term memory and latency to seizure. These results verify that blocking increased GluA2-lacking AMPARs may be a successful therapeutic strategy in CDD, and that both IEM-1460 and cannabidiol may attenuate hyperexcitability as well as autistic-like behaviors and memory deficits in CDD"

The detected variants among index patients comprised p.Ile196Val (n = 6); p.Ala174Thr (n = 3); p.Gly13Asp; p.Ala148Thr; and p.Arg181Gln in patients with MD; cervical dystonia; or WD. Two relatives of MD patients with WD also carried p.Ile196Val. The two variants identified in MD patients (p.Ile196Val; p.Gly13Asp) were characterized on endogenous levels in patient-derived fibroblasts and in two RAB12-overexpressing cell models. The ability to hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP), so called GTPase activity, was increased in mutants compared to wildtype. Furthermore, subcellular distribution of RAB12 in mutants was altered in fibroblasts. Soluble Transferrin receptor 1 levels were reduced in the blood of all three tested p.Ile196Val carriers. In conclusion, we demonstrate an enrichment of missense changes among dystonia patients. Functional characterization revealed altered enzyme activity and lysosomal distribution in mutants suggesting a contribution of RAB12 variants to MD and other dystonias"
0,Forebrain Deletion of αGDI in Adult Mice Worsens the Pre-Synaptic Deficit at Cortico-Lateral Amygdala Synaptic Connections,https://core.ac.uk/works/4014041,"The GDI1 gene encodes αGDI, which retrieves inactive GDP-bound RAB from membranes to form a cytosolic pool awaiting vesicular release. Mutations in GDI1 are responsible for X-linked Intellectual Disability. Characterization of the Gdi1-null mice has revealed alterations in the total number and distribution of hippocampal and cortical synaptic vesicles, hippocampal short-term synaptic plasticity and specific short-term memory deficits in adult mice, which are possibly caused by alterations of different synaptic vesicle recycling pathways controlled by several RAB GTPases. However, interpretation of these studies is complicated by the complete ablation of Gdi1 in all cells in the brain throughout development. In this study, we generated conditionally gene-targeted mice in which the knockout of Gdi1 is restricted to the forebrain, hippocampus, cortex and amygdala and occurs only during postnatal development. Adult mutant mice reproduce the short-term memory deficit previously reported in Gdi1-null mice. Surprisingly, the delayed ablation of Gdi1 worsens the pre-synaptic phenotype at cortico-amygdala synaptic connections compared to Gdi1-null mice. These results suggest a pivotal role of αGDI via specific RAB GTPases acting specifically in forebrain regions at the pre-synaptic sites involved in memory formation"
1,"Alpha-synuclein ferrireductase activity is detectible in vivo, is altered in Parkinson's disease and increases the neurotoxicity of DOPAL",https://core.ac.uk/works/8339247,"© 2017 Elsevier Inc. The normal cellular role of α-synuclein is of potential importance in understanding diseases in which an aggregated form of the protein has been implicated. A potential loss or change in the normal function of α-synuclein could play a role in the aetiology of diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Recently, it has been suggested that α-synuclein could cause the enzymatic reduction of iron and a cellular increase in Fe(II) levels. Experiments were carried out to determine if such activity could be measured in vivo. Experiments with rats overexpressing human α-synuclein in nigral dopaminergic neurons demonstrated a correlation between α-synuclein expression and ferrireductase activity. Furthermore, studies on tissue from Parkinson's disease patient brains showed a significant decrease in ferrireductase activity, possibly due to deposition of large amounts of inactive protein. Cellular studies suggest that increase ferrireductase activity results in increased levels of dopamine metabolites and increased sensitivity to the toxicity of DOPAL. These findings demonstrate that α-synuclein ferrireductase activity is present in vivo and its alteration may play a role in neuron loss in disease"
2,Autophagic- and Lysosomal-Related Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease : Lights and Shadows,https://core.ac.uk/works/112735966,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that currently affects 1% of the population over the age of 60 years, for which no disease-modifying treatments exist. This lack of effective treatments is related to the advanced stage of neurodegeneration existing at the time of diagnosis. Thus, the identification of early stage biomarkers is crucial. Biomarker discovery is often guided by the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to the pathology. One of the central pathways deregulated during PD, supported both by genetic and functional studies, is the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Hence, this review presents different studies on the expression and activity of autophagic and lysosomal proteins, and their functional consequences, performed in peripheral human biospecimens. Although most biomarkers are inconsistent between studies, some of them, namely HSC70 levels in sporadic PD patients, and cathepsin D levels and glucocerebrosidase activity in PD patients carrying GBA mutations, seem to be consistent. Hence, evidence exists that the impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway underlying PD pathophysiology can be detected in peripheral biosamples and further tested as potential biomarkers. However, longitudinal, stratified, and standardized analyses are needed to confirm their clinical validity and utility"

4,Identifying and analyzing novel epilepsy-related genes using random walk with restart algorithm.,https://core.ac.uk/works/18576420,"As a pathological condition, epilepsy is caused by abnormal neuronal discharge in brain which will temporarily disrupt the cerebral functions. Epilepsy is a chronic disease which occurs in all ages and would seriously affect patients' personal lives. Thus, it is highly required to develop effective medicines or instruments to treat the disease. Identifying epilepsy-related genes is essential in order to understand and treat the disease because the corresponding proteins encoded by the epilepsy-related genes are candidates of the potential drug targets. In this study, a pioneering computational workflow was proposed to predict novel epilepsy-related genes using the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm. As reported in the literature RWR algorithm often produces a number of false positive genes, and in this study a permutation test and functional association tests were implemented to filter the genes identified by RWR algorithm, which greatly reduce the number of suspected genes and result in only thirty-three novel epilepsy genes. Finally, these novel genes were analyzed based upon some recently published literatures. Our findings implicate that all novel genes were closely related to epilepsy. It is believed that the proposed workflow can also be applied to identify genes related to other diseases and deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of these diseases"
5,Rab GTPases as mediators of neuronal robustness in Drosophila,https://core.ac.uk/works/44169346,"One common feature of all eukaryotic cells is the presence of various specialized organelles,
separated by membranes, which necessitates a coordinated trafficking of materials between
these subcellular membrane-bound compartments. Especially neurons, with their long
lifespan, polarized and often complex morphology, as well as their specialized functions,
have particular requirements for membrane trafficking. Not surprisingly, membrane
trafficking is involved in all aspects of neuronal development, function, and long-term
maintenance. The evolutionary conserved family of small Rab GTPases functions as key
regulator of coordinated vesicular trafficking in the endomembrane system. Expression
profiling efforts revealed that in Drosophila half of all Rab GTPases are enriched in or
specific to the nervous system, in humans it is one-third. However, the exact functions of the
majority of nervous system-enriched Rab proteins are still unknown. Thus, studying the
individual roles of those Rab GTPases more closely provides a great opportunity to gain
more insight into the membrane trafficking networks in neurons. Ultimately, this will surely
contribute to the understanding of what keeps neurons and in particular synapses healthy and functional over extended periods of time. In the nervous system, Rab GTPases and the
membrane trafficking events these mediate have been widely associated with many
neurodegenerative diseases. However, the established relations are often more correlatively
than causatively linked, as discussed in Manuscript 1.
Regarding the importance of an intact intracellular trafficking machinery for the
development as well as neuronal function and maintenance, I primarily focused on the
systematic functional analysis of nervous system-enriched Rab GTPases in Drosophila
during my doctoral work. Previously, no systematic rab mutant characterization in any
multicellular organism had been performed. The analysis, presented in Manuscript 2,
revealed that the homozygous mutants of all nervous system-enriched Rab GTPases, raised
under laboratory conditions, are viable and fertile, whereas, null mutants of ubiquitously
expressed Rabs are all lethal under homozygosity. Thus, suggesting that Rab proteins, with
high expression in the nervous system, serve more modulatory, specialized functions which
are not essential for the survival of the organism. Further, we could show that all viable rab
mutants differentially affect the development or neuronal function under variable, more
challenging environmental conditions, such as temperature and light. This highlights the
evolved robustness of developmental processes and nervous system function towards
varying conditions. Additionally, during the in-depth functional analysis of nervous system-enriched Rab26, we revealed a stimulus-dependent role in the trafficking of the single
acetylcholine receptor subunit Dα4 at cholinergic synapses of outer photoreceptors.
However, we could not verify a role for Rab26 in the autophagic turnover of synaptic
vesicles in neurons.
Additional assays, such as the RUSH system, can be useful to support functional
analyses. While this acute, synchronous release system could be established for Rabs in
developing photoreceptors and salivary glands, wing imaginal discs proofed to be more
sensitive and no working conditions could be established. Using the RUSH assay, different
release dynamics with ‘fast’ as well as ‘slow’ releasing Rab GTPases could be identified as
shown in Manuscript 3. Further, two nervous system-enriched Rab proteins, namely Rab23
and Rab26, show a clear re-localization from the cell body to the axon terminals, which is
in agreement with their predominant synaptic neuropil localization revealed by expression
profiling.
In conclusion, the findings made during my doctoral work will contribute to a better
understanding of the functional requirements of neurons regarding Rab-mediated membrane trafficking. The complete rab null mutant collection as well as the RUSH and LAMA transgenic toolbox provide a strong basis for further investigations of individual Rab
functions during development and homeostasis"

7,Protein Stability Perturbation Contributes to the Loss of Function in Haploinsufficient Genes,https://core.ac.uk/works/107210618,"Missense variants are among the most studied genome modifications as disease biomarkers. It has been shown that the \u201cperturbation\u201d of the protein stability upon a missense variant (in terms of absolute \u394\u394G value, i.e., |\u394\u394G|) has a significant, but not predictive, correlation with the pathogenicity of that variant. However, here we show that this correlation becomes significantly amplified in haploinsufficient genes. Moreover, the enrichment of pathogenic variants increases at the increasing protein stability perturbation value. These findings suggest that protein stability perturbation might be considered as a potential cofactor in diseases associated with haploinsufficient genes reporting missense variants"

We propose and investigate two complementary statistical approaches for identification of rare causal variants in sequencing studies: a backward elimination procedure based on groupwise association tests, and a hierarchical approach that can integrate sequencing data with diverse functional and evolutionary conservation annotations for individual variants. Using simulations, we show that incorporation of multiple bioinformatic predictors of deleteriousness, such as PolyPhen-2, SIFT and GERP++ scores, can improve the power to discover truly causal variants. As proof of principle, we apply the proposed methods to VPS13B, a gene mutated in the rare neurodevelopmental disorder called Cohen syndrome, and recently reported with recessive variants in autism. We identify a small set of promising candidates for causal variants, including two loss-of-function variants and a rare, homozygous probably-damaging variant that could contribute to autism risk"
1,"Parkinson’s Disease and Fabry Disease: Clinical, Biochemical and Neuroimaging Analysis of Three Pedigrees",https://core.ac.uk/works/45379926,"Background: Sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have lower α-galactosidase A (α-GAL A) enzymatic activity and Fabry disease (FD) patients potentially carry an increased risk of PD.

Objective: Determination of PD prevalence in FD and clinical, biochemical and vascular neuroimaging description of FD pedigrees with concomitant PD.

Methods: Clinical screening for PD in 229 FD patients belonging to 31 families, harbouring GLA gene mutation p.F113L, and subsequent pedigree analysis. Gender-stratified comparison of FD+/PD+ patients with their family members with FD but without PD (FD+/PD-) regarding Mainz scores, plasma & leukocytes α-GAL A enzymatic activity, urinary Gb3 and plasma Lyso-Gb3, vascular brain neuroimaging.

Results: Prevalence of PD in FD was 1.3% (3/229) (3% in patients aged ≥50 years). Three FD patients, one female (73 years old) (P1) and two males (60 and 65 years old) (P2 and P3), three different pedigrees, presented akinetic-rigid PD, with weak response to levodopa (16% - 36%), and dopaminergic deficiency on 18F-DOPA PET. No pathogenic mutations were found in a PD gene panel. FD+/PD+ patients had worse clinical severity of FD (above upper 75% IQR in Mainz scores), and cortico-subcortical white matter/small vessel lesions. P3 patient was under enzyme therapy, started 1 year before PD diagnosis. P2-P3 patients had higher leucocyte α-GAL A activity (2,2-3 vs.1,0 (median)(nmol/h/mg)).

Conclusion: We have shown a high prevalence of PD in a late-onset phenotype of FD, presenting high cerebrovascular burden and weak response to levodopa. Further studies will untangle how much of this PD phenotype is due to Gb3 deposition versus cerebrovascular lesions in the nigro-striatal network.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio"
2,Defective Mitochondria Contribute to Impaired Translation in Spinal Muscular Atrophy,https://core.ac.uk/works/123900571,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating, autosomal-recessive neurodegenerative disease. It is characterized by the loss of alpha motor neurons (MNs) located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Degeneration of lower MNs leads to proximal muscle weakness and can ultimately result in respiratory failure. Accordingly, SMA is among the most common genetic causes of infant death. Causative for SMA is a reduced survival motor neuron (SMN) protein level. The reduction of ubiquitously expressed SMN results mainly from biallelic deletions or partially from point mutations in the SMN1 gene. Solely an almost identical copy of SMN1 - SMN2 - prevents embryonic lethality in SMA patients. A plethora of molecular defects, including RNA processing, protein synthesis, metabolic defects, and mitochondrial function, contribute to SMA pathology. Furthermore, reduced SMN levels delay maturation of acetylcholine receptor subunits and morphological and functional abnormalities at the neuromuscular junction.

Neurons highly depend on energy production via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by mitochondria. Dysfunctional mitochondria in SMA produce fewer ATP molecules and generate massive amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in oxidative stress. Oxidative stress challenges the cells with DNA damage, protein carbonylation, and impaired protein synthesis. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that defective mitochondria contribute to impaired protein synthesis in SMA. Another central question is whether in- creasing ATP and reducing oxidative stress ameliorates SMA pathology.

We performed a whole proteome analysis of cultured primary MNs, derived from SMA and WT embryos. Using mass spectrometry (MS), we confirmed previously known molecular mechanisms altered by SMN deficiency and contributing to SMA pathology. Particularly, a tendency of altered proteins localized to mitochondria was determined. In detail, complex I of the respiratory chain was identified as the major disturbed complex in SMA mitochondria. Besides alterations in mitochondrial protein abundance, immunostainings showed a decreased number and altered mitochondrial shape in the axon of SMA MNs. However, results from the whole proteome analysis and immunochemical results reveal an increase of mitochondrial proteins in whole-cell lysates, suggesting an accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in the soma.

Biochemical assays revealed functional impairments such as reduced ATP, impaired respiratory complex I activity, and increased ROS production. Additionally, a reduced glucose uptake suggested no compensation of energy deprivation by glycolysis. Previous studies implicated a reduced protein synthesis in SMA. We confirmed those findings with this study and further linked reduced protein synthesis to protein carbonylation resulting from increased oxidative stress. Moreover, we provide evidence that protein synthesis is also reduced in the axonal compartment of SMA MNs. Protein carbonylation and protein synthesis were quantified using immunochemical approaches. These findings prompted us to evaluate the mechanism of impaired protein synthesis. To decipher the contribution of translation initiation and elongation during impaired protein synthesis, we performed the SUnSET and SunRiSE assay, respectively. Based on our results, impaired protein synthesis in SMA results from impaired translation initiation and not elongation. While the SunRiSE assay shows a similar elongation speed in WT and SMA MNs, the phosphorylation status of the eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) reveals an impaired translation initiation in SMA MNs.

To increase ATP and decrease ROS, the cell culture medium of MNs and MN-like NSC-34 cells was supplied with lactate, pyruvate, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Effects of substrate supplementation on the whole proteome of MNs were determined by MS. Supplementation of pyruvate was able to increase ATP levels in SMA MNs, measured biochemically. Furthermore, pyruvate and NAC supplementation reduced excessive ROS and improved impaired protein synthesis, including local translation in SMA MNs.

While the antioxidant NAC can enhance global mRNA translation, pyruvate could only increase a subset of proteins. However, both pyruvate and NAC increased SMN in SMA MNs. Downstream targets of the mTOR pathway were measured immunochemically after NAC and pyruvate supplementation. Up-regulation of protein synthesis upon NAC and pyruvate supplementation is due to increased translation initiation mediated by the mTOR pathway. The mTOR-mediated increase of SMN after pyruvate supplementation was confirmed by pharmacological inhibition of the mTOR pathway.

In summary, we found that excessive ROS generated by defective complex I inhibits the initiation of mRNA translation in SMA MNs. Our findings suggest a new molecular networking system among dysfunctional mitochondria, excessive ROS production, and impaired protein synthesis via the mTOR pathway. This study opens up new treatment possibilities concerning SMA pathology by improving mitochondria, reducing ROS, and influencing impaired protein synthesis. As many neuropathies display molecular defects in mitochondria, including excessive ROS production, additional research fields despite SMA will benefit from our study"
3,Identification of novel TMPRSS2:ERG mechanisms in prostate cancer metastasis: involvement of MMP9 and PLXNA2,https://core.ac.uk/works/73963023,"International audienceProstate cancer (PCa) is one of the major public health problems in Western countries. Recently, the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion, which results in the aberrant expression of the transcription factor ERG, has been shown to be the most common gene rearrangement in PCa. Previous studies have determined the contributions of this fusion in PCa disease initiation and/or progression in vitro and in vivo. In this study on TMPRSS2:ERG regulation in PCa, we used an androgen receptor and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion double-negative PCa cell model: PC3c. In three cell clones with different TMPRSS2:ERG expression levels, ectopic expression of the fusion resulted in significant induction of cell migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner. In agreement with this phenotype, high-throughput microarray analysis revealed that a set of genes, functionally associated with cell motility and invasiveness, were deregulated in a dose-dependent manner in TMPRSS2:ERG-expressing cells. Importantly, we identified increased MMP9 (Metalloproteinase 9) and PLXNA2 (Plexin A2) expression in TMPRSS2:ERG-positive PCa samples, and their expression levels were significantly correlated with ERG expression in a PCa cohort. In line with these findings, there was evidence that TMPRSS2:ERG directly and positively regulates MMP9 and PLXNA2 expression in PC3c cells. Moreover, PLXNA2 upregulation contributed to TMPRSS2:ERG-mediated enhancements of PC3c cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, and importantly, PLXNA2 expression was upregulated in metastatic PCa tumors compared with localized primary PCa tumors. This study provides novel insights into the role of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in PCa metastasis"
4,Endocytic Rabs Are Recruited to the Trypanosoma cruzi Parasitophorous Vacuole and Contribute to the Process of Infection in Non-professional Phagocytic Cells,https://core.ac.uk/works/41068502,"Trypanosoma cruzi is the parasite causative of Chagas disease, a highly disseminated illness endemic in Latin-American countries. T. cruzi has a complex life cycle that involves mammalian hosts and insect vectors both of which exhibits different parasitic forms. Trypomastigotes are the infective forms capable to invade several types of host cells from mammals. T. cruzi infection process comprises two sequential steps, the formation and the maturation of the Trypanosoma cruzi parasitophorous vacuole. Host Rab GTPases are proteins that control the intracellular vesicular traffic by regulating budding, transport, docking, and tethering of vesicles. From over 70 Rab GTPases identified in mammalian cells only two, Rab5 and Rab7 have been found in the T. cruzi vacuole to date. In this work, we have characterized the role of the endocytic, recycling, and secretory routes in the T. cruzi infection process in CHO cells, by studying the most representative Rabs of these pathways. We found that endocytic Rabs are selectively recruited to the vacuole of T. cruzi, among them Rab22a, Rab5, and Rab21 right away after the infection followed by Rab7 and Rab39a at later times. However, neither recycling nor secretory Rabs were present in the vacuole membrane at the times studied. Interestingly loss of function of endocytic Rabs by the use of their dominant-negative mutant forms significantly decreases T. cruzi infection. These data highlight the contribution of these proteins and the endosomal route in the process of T. cruzi infection.Fil: Salassa, Betiana Nebaí.

6,Phosphoproteomic screening identifies Rab GTPases as novel downstream targets of PINK1,https://core.ac.uk/works/8709784,"International audienceMutations in the PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are causative of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). We have previously reported that PINK1 is activated by mitochondrial depolarisation and phosphorylates serine 65 (Ser 65) of the ubiquitin ligase Parkin and ubiquitin to stimulate Parkin E3 ligase activity. Here, we have employed quantitative phosphoproteomics to search for novel PINK1-dependent phosphorylation targets in HEK (human embry-onic kidney) 293 cells stimulated by mitochondrial depolarisation. This led to the identification of 14,213 phosphosites from 4,499 gene products. Whilst most phosphosites were unaffected, we strikingly observed three members of a sub-family of Rab GTPases namely Rab8A, 8B and 13 that are all phosphorylated at the highly conserved residue of serine 111 (Ser 111) in response to PINK1 activation. Using phospho-specific antibodies raised against Ser 111 of each of the Rabs, we demonstrate that Rab Ser 111 phosphoryla-tion occurs specifically in response to PINK1 activation and is abolished in HeLa PINK1 knockout cells and mutant PINK1 PD patient-derived fibroblasts stimulated by mitochondrial depolari-sation. We provide evidence that Rab8A GTPase Ser 111 phosphory-lation is not directly regulated by PINK1 in vitro and demonstrate in cells the time course of Ser 111 phosphorylation of Rab8A, 8B and 13 is markedly delayed compared to phosphorylation of Parkin at Ser 65. We further show mechanistically that phosphorylation at Ser 111 significantly impairs Rab8A activation by its cognate guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Rabin8 (by using the Ser111Glu phosphorylation mimic). These findings provide the first evidence that PINK1 is able to regulate the phosphorylation of Rab GTPases and indicate that monitoring phosphorylation of Rab8A/ 8B/13 at Ser 111 may represent novel biomarkers of PINK1 activity in vivo. Our findings also suggest that disruption of Rab GTPase-mediated signalling may represent a major mechanism in the neurodegenerative cascade of Parkinson's disease"
7,Folic acid supplementation normalizes the endothelial progenitor cell transcriptome of patients with type 1 diabetes: a case-control pilot study,https://core.ac.uk/works/3734661,"Background: Endothelial progenitor cells play an important role in vascular wall repair. Patients with type 1 diabetes have reduced levels of endothelial progenitor cells of which their functional capacity is impaired. Reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and increased oxidative stress play a role in endothelial progenitor cell dysfunction in these patients. Folic acid, a B-vitamin with anti-oxidant properties, may be able to improve endothelial progenitor cell function. In this study, we investigated the gene expression profiles of endothelial progenitor cells from patients with type 1 diabetes compared to endothelial progenitor cells from healthy subjects. Furthermore, we studied the effect of folic acid on gene expression profiles of endothelial progenitor cells from patients with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We used microarray analysis to investigate the gene expression profiles of endothelial progenitor cells from type 1 diabetes patients before (n = 11) and after a four week period of folic acid supplementation (n = 10) compared to the gene expression profiles of endothelial progenitor cells from healthy subjects (n = 11). The probability of genes being differentially expressed among the classes was computed using a random-variance t-test. A multivariate permutation test was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed among the two classes. Functional classification of differentially expressed genes was performed using the biological process ontology in the Gene Ontology database. Results: Type 1 diabetes significantly modulated the expression of 1591 genes compared to healthy controls. These genes were found to be involved in processes regulating development, cell communication, cell adhesion and localization. After folic acid treatment, endothelial progenitor cell gene expression profiles from diabetic patients were similar to those from healthy controls. Genes that were normalized by folic acid played a prominent role in development, such as the transcription factors ID1 and MAFF. Few oxidative-stress related genes were affected by folic acid. Conclusion: Folic acid normalizes endothelial progenitor cell gene expression profiles of patients with type 1 diabetes. Signaling pathways modulated by folic acid may be potential therapeutic targets to improve endothelial progenitor cell function"
8,"Analysis of Hepatocyte Secretion Pathways: A Case Study on Hepatic Apolipoproteins, Serum Albumin, and Hepatitis C Virus",https://core.ac.uk/works/47663115,"The hepatocyte is one of the major secretory cell types in the body. It fulfills many of the liver\u27s essential functions in protein secretion, lipid storage and transport, and excretion. Some of these functions are carried out via polarized secretion of simple protein cargo, such as serum albumin, or large macromolecular lipid-protein complexes, the lipoproteins. The hepatocyte is also the site of infection of several hepatotropic viruses. Of these, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is peculiar due to its close structural and functional association with the hepatic lipoproteins. All these cargoes are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface by the vesicular secretory pathway, yet insufficient knowledge exists regarding the molecular regulation of their secretion by the hepatocyte. Furthermore, differential modalities of regulation may be involved in the shuttling of such a diverse set of cargoes as albumin, the lipoproteins and HCV.  The work presented here head-starts a comprehensive examination of how the hepatocyte regulates the secretion of the following cargoes: serum albumin, the apolipoproteins E and B100 (ApoE and ApoB100, respectively, both lipoprotein components, and surrogate markers for these complex macromolecular particles), and HCV, a lipoprotein-associated virus. I propose to combine genetic, biochemical, virological and imaging approaches to identify which vesicular secretory pathways are utilized by each of these cargoes. These approaches include inactivation of specific vesicular transport pathways, accompanied by measurements of their effects on cargo secretion efficiencies, and establishment of functional fluorescent protein-tagged cargo markers to be used in live cell imaging experiments. I begin by describing a dominant negative (DN) Rab GTPase screen that I  performed to identify Rab proteins involved in ApoE, ApoB100 or albumin secretion.  The small Rab GTPases control individual steps of vesicular transport. I analyzed how expression of individual dominant negative Rab proteins affected cargo secretion compared to expression of their wild type (WT) counterparts. I identified several Rabs that caused significant changes in secretion, many of which had previously been described as regulators of various exocytic vesicular transport steps.  I next present ongoing work that aims to define the involvement of the Rabs 11a, 11b, 8a, and 8b in hepatic cargo secretion. Their dominant negative mutants exhibited some of the largest secretion phenotypes in my dominant negative Rab screen. These Rabs have been implicated in various aspects of post-Golgi secretion in polarized and non-polarized cell types. I thus discuss the implications of their involvement in cargo secretion in the polarized hepatocyte and outline my ongoing efforts to define the parameters of this involvement.  I also investigated the function of Rab1b in hepatic secretion. I show that inactivation of Rab1 function, by expression of a set of dominant negative mutants, or by expression of a bacterial effector which affects Rab1 function, led to impairment of albumin, ApoE, ApoB100 and HCV secretion. I implicate Rab1, for the first time to my knowledge, in the transport of these cargoes. I also document differences in the sensitivity of cargo secretion to the various means of Rab1 inactivation. ApoE secretion, in particular, was insensitive to several means of transport inactivation, consistent with existing models of differential regulation of hepatic cargo transport.  Lastly, I functionally characterize an ApoE-green fluorescent protein fusion (ApoE-GFP). I show that while ApoE-GFP does not support infectious HCV release, a hallmark function of untagged ApoE, ApoE-GFP nevertheless reproduces several known behaviors of ApoE that have been associated with lipoprotein release. I thus conclude that ApoE-GFP may be a useful marker for live cell imaging of lipoprotein release.  This work therefore identifies potential regulators of hepatic cargo transport, establishes molecular tools useful for the continued study of cargo secretion in hepatocytes and elsewhere, and advances the understanding of the involvement of Rabs 11, 8, and, in particular, Rab1, in the regulation of hepatic cargo transport. I propose that this work forms a solid foundation for extensive studies on how these biomedically relevant hepatic cargoes are secreted"
9,Breast cancer cell lines carry cell line-specific genomic alterations that are distinct from aberrations in breast cancer tissues: Comparison of the CGH profiles between cancer cell lines and primary cancer tissues,https://core.ac.uk/works/3783965,"<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>Cell lines are commonly used in various kinds of biomedical research in the world. However, it remains uncertain whether genomic alterations existing in primary tumor tissues are represented in cell lines and whether cell lines carry cell line-specific genomic alterations. This study was performed to answer these questions.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was employed with 4030 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) that cover the genome at 1.0 megabase resolution to analyze DNA copy number aberrations (DCNAs) in 35 primary breast tumors and 24 breast cancer cell lines. DCNAs were compared between these two groups. A tissue microdissection technique was applied to primary tumor tissues to reduce the contamination of samples by normal tissue components.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>The average number of BAC clones with DCNAs was 1832 (45.3% of spotted clones) and 971 (24.9%) for cell lines and primary tumor tissues, respectively. Gains of 1q and 8q and losses of 8p, 11q, 16q and 17p were detected in >50% of primary cancer tissues. These aberrations were also frequently detected in cell lines. In addition to these alterations, the cell lines showed recurrent genomic alterations including gains of 5p14-15, 20q11 and 20q13 and losses of 4p13-p16, 18q12, 18q21, Xq21.1 and Xq26-q28 that were barely detected in tumor tissue specimens. These are considered to be cell line-specific DCNAs. The frequency of the HER2 amplification was high in both cell lines and tumor tissues, but it was statistically different between cell lines and primary tumors (P = 0.012); 41.3 ± 29.9% for the cell lines and 15.9 ± 18.6% for the tissue specimens.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>Established cell lines carry cell lines-specific DCNAs together with recurrent aberrations detected in primary tumor tissues. It must therefore be emphasized that cell lines do not always represent the genotypes of parental tumor tissues.</p"
0,Chloride intracellular channel proteins respond to heat stress in Caenorhabditis elegans,https://core.ac.uk/works/63331445,"Chloride intracellular channel proteins (CLICs) are multi-functional proteins that are expressed in various cell types and differ in their subcellular location. Two CLIC homologs, EXL-1 (excretory canal abnormal like-1) and EXC-4 (excretory canal abnormal± 4), are encoded in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, providing an excellent model to study the functional diversification of CLIC proteins. EXC-4 functions in excretory canal formation during normal animal development. However, to date, the physiological function of EXL-1 remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that EXL-1 responds specifically to heat stress and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in intestinal cells and body wall muscle cells under heat shock. In contrast, we do not observe EXC-4 nuclear translocation under heat shock. Full protein sequence analysis shows that EXL-1 bears a non-classic nuclear localization signal (NLS) that EXC-4 is lacking. All mammalian CLIC members have a nuclear localization signal, with the exception of CLIC3. Our phylogenetic analysis of the CLIC gene families across various animal species demonstrates that the duplication of CLICs in protostomes and deuterostomes occurred independently and that the NLS was subsequently lost in amniotes and nematodes, suggesting convergent evolution. We also observe that EXL-1 nuclear translocation occurs in a timely ordered manner in the intestine, from posterior to anterior regions. Finally, we find that exl-1 loss of function mutants are more susceptible to heat stress than wild-type animals, demonstrating functional relevance of the nuclear translocation. This research provides the first link between CLICs and environmental heat stress. We propose that C. elegans CLICs evolved to achieve different physiological functions through subcellular localization change and spatial separation in response to external or internal signals"
1,Gene family information facilitates variant interpretation and identification of disease-associated genes in neurodevelopmental disorders,https://core.ac.uk/works/18769896,"Background Classifying pathogenicity of missense variants represents a major challenge in clinical practice during the diagnoses of rare and genetic heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). While orthologous gene conservation is commonly employed in variant annotation, approximately 80% of known disease-associated genes belong to gene families. The use of gene family information for disease gene discovery and variant interpretation has not yet been investigated on a genome-wide scale. We empirically evaluate whether paralog-conserved or non-conserved sites in human gene families are important in NDDs. Methods Gene family information was collected from Ensembl. Paralog-conserved sites were defined based on paralog sequence alignments; 10,068 NDD patients and 2078 controls were statistically evaluated for de novo variant burden in gene families. Results We demonstrate that disease-associated missense variants are enriched at paralog-conserved sites across all disease groups and inheritance models tested. We developed a gene family de novo enrichment framework that identified 43 exome-wide enriched gene families including 98 de novo variant carrying genes in NDD patients of which 28 represent novel candidate genes for NDD which are brain expressed and under evolutionary constraint. Conclusion This study represents the first method to incorporate gene family information into a statistical framework to interpret variant data for NDDs and to discover new NDD-associated genes"
2,Investigating early functional alteration in a human iPSC-based model of Parkinson’s Disease,https://core.ac.uk/works/14124840,"[eng] Dopaminergic neurons (DAn) were efficiently differentiated from 6 different iPSC lines derived from a 2 control, 3 PD lines, and an isogenic PD line. We characterize the culture at different time point in order to verify the composition of the culture. At day 35 almost 50% of the cells expressed the neuronal marker TUJ1, of which 20% were of DA lineage as judged by TH expression. No astrocytes were found in the culture. Interestingly at day 50 of differentiation the amount of DAn increased up to 25-35% of which 35% were expressing Girk2, a midbrain DA neuronal marker that was not expressed at day 35 and 45-60% of the DA neurons express FOXA2, another important transcription factor that confirm the midbrain fate. Even more importantly, at day 80 of the differentiation process, the amount of DAn that expressed Girk2 increased up to 50%, while the expression of FOXA2 in DA remain stable, confirming the ventral midbrain phenotype. We then test for each line the neuronal activity by calcium imaging assay. Comparing the two groups of controls and isogenic PD line versus PD lines, interestingly we identify two distinct patterns of activity: controls lines display a mixed mode, oscillatory activity normally associated with healthy networks while PD lines display a two-state dynamics, with strong bursting combined with intervals of almost no activity that suggest an impairment in the communication between the neurons. These dynamic differences suggest a more in depth analysis of the functional network that controls and PD create. Using a custom algorithm we demonstrate that just the PD lines were functionally impaired because their neurons, especially at day 80, were not able to form a homogeneous network like the controls one that can be described as a scale-free like systems. Analyzing separately TH and non TH neurons we were able to conclude that the functional connectivity of PD1 lines shows a higher departure from the controls lines along maturation, which indicates poor information flow efficiency. Particularly, PD TH+ neurons connectomes display abnormal network organization that occurs primarily before the general alteration of the network, suggesting that TH+ are leading to general neural connectome alteration. Due to the biophysical simulation analysis we were able to identify as a cause of the functional impairment the reduction in the neurite arborization TH specific just in the PD lines and confirm this phenotype in our biological samples. We then used our in vitro model to take a step backwards and examine the biological and molecular behavior before the functional alteration manifests. We analyzed the culture at D50, when the data suggests that the functional alteration has not yet developed fully, using gene expression profile analysis to identify possible deregulations in pathways that can be connected to the altered functionality. Bioinformatics analysis focused on differentially expressed genes, selected with a pAdjValue of 0.05 and a fold change ≤-2 and ≥ 2. Within these strict selection criteria, we were unable to highlight any gene related to LRRK2 PD and isogenic PD. This confirms the validity of the in vitro model and the robustness of the differentiation protocol and shows that the functional phenotype is not due to macroscopic neurodegenerative conditions.[spa] La enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es una enfermedad incurable, crónica y progresiva que conduce a la invalidez prematura y la muerte. Se espera que el diagnóstico temprano de la EP mejore dramáticamente el resultado de las terapias actuales. Para ello, empleamos un modelo de EP basado en células neuronales humanas, para detectar alteraciones funcionales tempranas que nos den un diagnostico de la enfermedad antes de la aparición de síntomas motores. Utilizando neuronas derivadas de células madre pluripotentes inducidas (iPSC) de individuos sanos y pacientes con EP asociados con la mutación familiar en el gen LRRK2, hemos comprobado que los dos grupos forman redes complejas y muestran signos evidentes de maduración funcional a lo largo del tiempo. Sin embargo, las redes neuronales de la EP desarrollaron una híper-sincronía anormal, en comparación con las redes de los controles y de la línea isogénica de LRRK2. En esto estudio combinamos análisis de la actividad neuronal a lo largo de tiempo utilizando la técnica del “calcium imaging”, un modelo in silico de “network”, líneas reporteras de neuronas dopaminérgicas, y el análisis del perfil de expresión génica. Con estos experimentos, encontramos que una disminución en la longitud de la neurita de neuronas dopaminérgicas es, entre otras causas, una de las primeras alteraciones funcionales presentes en la red de neuronas derivada de EP. Por lo tanto, nuestros resultados identifican alteraciones tempranas en la función neuronal de la EP que son anteriores al inicio de la degeneración neuronal, resaltando la extraordinaria ventaja que ofrece este modelo de iPSC en la evaluación pre sintomática de las enfermedades degenerativas crónicas"
3,Gatekeeper of pluripotency: a common Oct4 transcriptional network operates in mouse eggs and embryonic stem cells,https://core.ac.uk/works/41179718,"BACKGROUND: Oct4 is a key factor of an expanded transcriptional network (Oct4-TN) that governs pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in  the inner cell mass from which ESCs are derived. A pending question is whether the establishment of the Oct4-TN initiates during oogenesis or after fertilisation. To this regard, recent evidence has shown that Oct4 controls a poorly known Oct4-TN central to the acquisition of the mouse egg developmental competence. The aim of this study was to investigate the identity and extension of this maternal Oct4-TN, as much as whether its presence is circumscribed to the egg or maintained beyond fertilisation. RESULTS: By comparing the genome-wide transcriptional profile of developmentally competent eggs that express the OCT4 protein to that of developmentally incompetent eggs in which OCT4 is down-regulated, we unveiled a maternal Oct4-TN of 182 genes. Eighty of these transcripts escape post-fertilisation degradation and represent the maternal Oct4-TN inheritance that is passed on to the 2-cell embryo. Most of these 80 genes are expressed in cancer cells and 37 are notable companions of the Oct4 transcriptome in ESCs. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide, for the first time, a  developmental link between eggs, early preimplantation embryos and ESCs, indicating that the molecular signature that characterises the ESCs identity is rooted in oogenesis. Also, they contribute a useful resource to further study the mechanisms of Oct4 function and regulation during the maternal-to-embryo transition and to explore the link between the regulation of pluripotency and the acquisition of de-differentiation in cancer cells"

Also my studies suggest that NS4B regulates a newly identified oncogenic pathway. For hepatitis E virus, I looked for the cellular effects conferred by the capsid protein ORF2, and the results showed that ORF2 induced activation of CHOP did not lead to apoptosis which might be due to the up regulation of anti-apoptotic chaperones like Hsp72"
5,A proteomics approach to decipher the molecular nature of planarian stem cells,https://core.ac.uk/works/3907001,"Background In recent years, planaria have emerged as an important model system for research into stem cells and regeneration. Attention is focused on their unique stem cells, the neoblasts, which can differentiate into any cell type present in the adult organism. Sequencing of the Schmidtea mediterranea genome and some expressed sequence tag projects have generated extensive data on the genetic profile of these cells. However, little information is available on their protein dynamics. Results We developed a proteomic strategy to identify neoblast-specific proteins. Here we describe the method and discuss the results in comparison to the genomic high-throughput analyses carried out in planaria and to proteomic studies using other stem cell systems. We also show functional data for some of the candidate genes selected in our proteomic approach. Conclusions We have developed an accurate and reliable mass-spectra-based proteomics approach to complement previous genomic studies and to further achieve a more accurate understanding and description of the molecular and cellular processes related to the neoblasts"
6,Pericentrosomal targeting of Rab6 secretory vesicles by Bicaudal-D-related protein 1 (BICDR-1) regulates neuritogenesis,https://core.ac.uk/works/3804404,"Membrane and secretory trafficking are essential for proper neuronal development. However, the molecular mechanisms that organize secretory trafficking are poorly understood. Here, we identify Bicaudal-D-related protein 1 (BICDR-1) as an effector of the small GTPase Rab6 and key component of the molecular machinery that controls secretory vesicle transport in developing neurons. BICDR-1 interacts with kinesin motor Kif1C, the dynein/dynactin retrograde motor complex, regulates the pericentrosomal localization of Rab6-positive secretory vesicles and is required for neural development in zebrafish. BICDR-1 expression is high during early neuronal development and strongly declines during neurite outgrowth. In young neurons, BICDR-1 accumulates Rab6 secretory vesicles around the centrosome, restricts anterograde secretory transport and inhibits neuritogenesis. Later during development, BICDR-1 expression is strongly reduced, which permits anterograde secretory transport required for neurite outgrowth. These results indicate an important role for BICDR-1 as temporal regulator of secretory trafficking during the early phase of neuronal differentiation"
7,In vivo visual screen for dopaminergic Rab ⇿ LRRK2-G2019S interactions in Drosophila discriminates Rab10 from Rab3,https://core.ac.uk/works/8438618,"LRRK2 mutations cause Parkinson’s, but the molecular link from increased kinase activity to pathological neurodegeneration remains undetermined. Previous in vitro assays indicate that LRRK2 substrates include at least 8 Rab GTPases. We have now examined this hypothesis in vivo in a functional, electroretinogram screen, expressing each Rab with/without LRRK2-G2019S in selected Drosophila dopaminergic neurons. Our screen discriminated Rab10 from Rab3. The strongest Rab/LRRK2-G2019S interaction is with Rab10; the weakest with Rab3. Rab10 is expressed in a different set of dopaminergic neurons from Rab3. Thus, anatomical and physiological patterns of Rab10 are related. We conclude that Rab10 is a valid substrate of LRRK2 in dopaminergic neurons in vivo. We propose that variations in Rab expression contribute to differences in the rate of neurodegeneration recorded in different dopaminergic nuclei in Parkinson’s"

1,Phenotypes and Variants in Cases Submitted for  X-Linked Intellectual Disability (XLID) Gene Panel Testing,https://core.ac.uk/works/63570453,"Intellectual disability (ID) refers to reduced cognitive function, apparent before the age of 18, that negatively affects a person\u27s learning and adaptive capacity. Approximately 1-3% of the population is affected with ID, males more than females, and most in the mild-to-moderate range. ID creates financial, logistical and psychosocial challenges for affected persons and their families and caregivers. It is estimated that up to 50% of ID has a genetic cause. Molecular genetic diagnosis may help in obtaining services and has important implications for family members, but can be elusive. Genes causing ID are known to be over-represented on the X chromosome. Over 160 X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndromes and more than 100 XLID genes have been identified to date. Greenwood Genetic Center (GGC) offers a next-generation sequencing panel of approximately 90 XLID genes. The diagnostic potential offered by large gene panels is offset by the challenges of interpreting variants of uncertain significance (VUS). In this study, molecular and clinical data from 592 cases submitted for XLID panel testing were evaluated for patterns of phenotype and genotype, in order to further the understanding of XLID. We found a low pathogenic hit rate, a high VUS-only rate and a general absence of statistically significant phenotypic patterns. These results highlight the need for appropriate patient selection, full and accurate phenotype reporting and open sharing of information in order to interpret and learn from the results of genetic testing"
2,Prediction of Human Disease Genes by Human-Mouse Conserved Coexpression Analysis,https://core.ac.uk/works/3506688,"One of the most limiting aspects of biological research in the post-genomic era is the capability to integrate massive datasets on gene structure and function for producing useful biological knowledge. In this report we have applied an integrative approach to address the problem of identifying likely candidate genes within loci associated with human genetic diseases. Despite the recent progress in sequencing technologies, approaching this problem from an experimental perspective still represents a very demanding task, because the critical region may typically contain hundreds of positional candidates. We found that by concentrating only on genes sharing similar expression profiles in both human and mouse, massive microarray datasets can be used to reliably identify disease-relevant relationships among genes. Moreover, we found that integrating the coexpression criterion with systematic phenome analysis allows efficient identification of disease genes in large genomic regions. Using this approach on 850 OMIM loci characterized by unknown molecular basis, we propose high-probability candidates for 81 genetic diseases"
3,Gene Expression during the Activation of Human B Cells,https://core.ac.uk/works/10953572,"Human B lymphocytes not only play a critical role in the humoral immunity to generate antibodies, but also are equally important to cellular immunity as B lymphocytes can present antigens to T lymphocytes and can release a range of potential immune-regulating cytokines after stimulations. Human immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) in activated B cells is an essential process in the humoral immunity and the process is complicated and tightly controlled by many regulators. The recent genomic and genetic approaches in CSR identified novel genes that were actively involved in the process. Understanding the roles of the novel genes in CSR will bring new insights into the mechanisms of the process and new potential therapeutic targets for immunoglobulin-related disorders such as allergic asthma and autoimmune diseases"
4,Contribution of x-linked genes to the origin and development of intellectual disability in patients from the spanish Basque Country,https://core.ac.uk/works/109496223,"167 p.La Discapacidad Intelectual (DI) es un desorden del neurodesarrollo que afecta aproximadamente al 1-3 % de la población y que supone un serio problema, tanto médico como social, en los países desarrollados. La DI ligada al cromosoma X (XLID) representa un grupo importante, por haber más varones que mujeres con DI y en muchos casos se segrega además vía materna. En los últimos años, las tecnologías de secuenciación masiva (NGS), han contribuido de forma importante al diagnóstico de la XLID, lo que nos hizo plantear la HIPÓTESIS de que en nuestros pacientes sin filiar podríamos aplicar la NGS encontrando nuevos genes/variantes causantes de DI y aplicando estos resultados al diagnóstico y al Consejo genético en las familias.- OBJETIVOS: Se marcaron 3 objetivos, cuyos resultados siguen el mismo orden:- RESULTADOS:1.- Se revisó la base de datos del laboratorio de los 1909 pacientes varones que llegaron para el estudio del gen FMR1 durante 1991-2015. Se seleccionaron 230 que tenían historia familiar (el 12%) y se cuantificaron y clasificaron los 59 diagnósticos moleculares ya obtenidos, la mayoría de los cualesestaban ligados al X (52/59), siendo el Síndrome X Frágil el más prevalente (43 casos) y demostrando ya la importancia de los genes del X en el origen de la DI (52/230=22,6%).2.- Se diseñó un panel de 82 genes del X para aplicarlo por NGS a los casos sin filiar. En total se estudiaron con el panel 61 pacientes varones con posible DI ligada al X. Se identificaron 17 variantes candidatas en 16 pacientes (16/61=26.23%) y se pudieron recontactar 6 familias con 7 variantes para estudios de cosegregación. Esto hizo posible la interpretación de algunas variantes como patogénicas, probablemente patogénicas o benignas.3.-Se validó el panel de genes del X comparándolo con el exoma completo en trio en 13 parejas de hermanos varones con DI. Aunque el panel de genes resultó en una tasa más baja de diagnóstico (1/13) que el exoma (4/13), el panel ofreció una mayor profundidad de cobertura de las regiones cubiertas y por lo tanto mejor detección de variantes. Finalmente, juntando los datos de estas 13 familias con las parejas de hermanos de la base de datos que ya tenían diagnóstico molecular (en total 45), se comprobó que la mayoría tenían variantes en el cromosoma X (15/45) por lo que la contribución del cromosoma X es del 33.33% en nuestra cohorte de parejas de hermanos con DI.- CONCLUSIONES: Este estudio demuestra la importante contribución de los genes del X en pacientes varones con DI e historia familiar, del orden del 22 al 33% en nuestra cohorte. Además, este trabajo ha demostrado la utilidad del panel de genes del X en el desciframiento de la DI ligada al X; ha puesto de manifiesto las limitaciones de los análisis de segregación y la necesidad de los estudios funcionales; y ha demostrado la necesidad de estudiar retrospectivamente los pacientes para aplicarles las nuevas tecnologías con el fin de lograr más y mejores diagnósticos genéticos moleculare"
5,A Brain Region-Specific Predictive Gene Map for Autism Derived by Profiling a Reference Gene Set,https://core.ac.uk/works/3999186,"Molecular underpinnings of complex psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) remain largely unresolved. Increasingly, structural variations in discrete chromosomal loci are implicated in ASD, expanding the search space for its disease etiology. We exploited the high genetic heterogeneity of ASD to derive a predictive map of candidate genes by an integrated bioinformatics approach. Using a reference set of 84 Rare and Syndromic candidate ASD genes (AutRef84), we built a composite reference profile based on both functional and expression analyses. First, we created a functional profile of AutRef84 by performing Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis which encompassed three main areas: 1) neurogenesis/projection, 2) cell adhesion, and 3) ion channel activity. Second, we constructed an expression profile of AutRef84 by conducting DAVID analysis which found enrichment in brain regions critical for sensory information processing (olfactory bulb, occipital lobe), executive function (prefrontal cortex), and hormone secretion (pituitary). Disease specificity of this dual AutRef84 profile was demonstrated by comparative analysis with control, diabetes, and non-specific gene sets. We then screened the human genome with the dual AutRef84 profile to derive a set of 460 potential ASD candidate genes. Importantly, the power of our predictive gene map was demonstrated by capturing 18 existing ASD-associated genes which were not part of the AutRef84 input dataset. The remaining 442 genes are entirely novel putative ASD risk genes. Together, we used a composite ASD reference profile to generate a predictive map of novel ASD candidate genes which should be prioritized for future research"
6,New roles of Rab GTPases on eye diseases: targeting VEGF secretion,https://core.ac.uk/works/46051851,"RESUMO: A retina é composta, entre outras estruturas, pelo epitélio pigmentar da retina (EPR)e pela coróide. A região central da retina denomina-se mácula, e é a zona mais afetada na degenerescência macular relacionada com a idade, a forma mais comum de degenerescência da retina. Nesta doença, a secreção de fatores de crescimento pelo EPR é afetada, nomeadamente a do fator de crescimento vascular endotelial (VEGF), e pouco se sabe ainda sobre os mecanismos moleculares conducentes a esta condição. A família de proteínas Rab GTPases está envolvida nas vias intracelulares de sinalização e tráfego membranares, essenciais na transdução de sinais extracelulares em respostas biológicas. A
sua crucial importância nestes mecanismos levou-nos a considerar o seu potencial
envolvimento nas vias de secreção do VEGF, e a questionar-nos se teriam algum papel
regulador sobre as mesmas. O principal objetivo deste trabalho é identificar Rab GTPases importantes para as vias de secreção e endocitose do VEGF no EPR. Essa identificação ajudará a esclarecer a patogénese da degenerescência macular da retina, e poderá servir para uma procura mais direcionada de novos agentes terapêuticos. A caracterização de dois
modelos in vitro do EPR, células primárias isoladas de murganho e a linha celular B6-RPE07,levou-nos a concluir que são ambos semelhantes. Contudo, a linha celular foi escolhida como protótipo do EPR por permitir o acesso a um número ilimitado de células. No decurso deste trabalho, desenvolvemos e caracterizámos uma biblioteca de ferramentas moleculares que nos permitiram reduzir os níveis proteicos das proteínas Rab GTPases, com base na tecnologia de ácido ribonucleico (ARN) de interferência. O papel das proteínas Rab GTPases na secreção do VEGF no EPR foi estudado com base no silenciamento de apenas uma proteína, ou combinando várias, segundo a sua localização e funções intracelulares descritas. Este trabalho permitiu-nos concluir que as proteínas Rab GTPases são importantes intervenientes no processo de secreção de VEGF pelo EPR, e confirmar dados anteriores que relatam o envolvimento de algumas Rab GTPases endocíticas no processo. Propomos ainda
um novo modelo para a interação destas proteínas no EPR, e sugerimos que a Rab10 e a
Rab14 atuam negativamente sobre a Rab8, controlando o seu funcionamento. Os nossos
resultados evidenciam a importância das proteínas Rab GTPases na secreção do VEGF pelas células do EPR, e servem de base a futuros estudos que melhor procurem compreender este mecanismo e de que modo a sua alteração se relaciona com a degenerescência da retina.--------ABSTRACT: Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid are components of the mammalian retina, of which the central region is called macula. The most common form of retinaldegeneration, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), involves primarily deregulation of
growth factors secretion by the RPE. Very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to impairment of RPE’s homeostatic intracellular processes, namely the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Rab GTPases’ family regulates membrane targeting and traffic, being essential in the transduction of signal pathways. Given Rab proteins’ role in intracellular trafficking, we propose to identify key regulatory Rab proteins
involved in either the secretory or the recycling pathways of VEGF in RPE. Understanding how Rab proteins’ function disruption could lead to retinal and choroidal pathology would ultimately contribute to find new therapeutic agents. Here, we characterized two mouse RPE
in vitro cell models, primary cells and B6-RPE07 cell line, and concluded that both display important epithelial features as the RPE presents in vivo. Considering unlimited cell number and results reproducibility, we chose B6-RPE07 cells to further study Rab proteins’ function.
To scrutinize the consequences of Rab proteins’ absence or diminished levels, we have developed novel molecular tools to achieve silencing of these key proteins using miRNA technology. We further addressed the effect of Rab proteins’ absence on VEGF secretion by performing an extensive screening where different Rab proteins were silenced, both individually and in multiple combinations considering their cellular/ compartment location.
We conclude that Rab GTPases are important intervenients in VEGF secretion by RPE cells,
confirming endocytic Rab proteins’ role in regulation of VEGF biology. We also propose a
novel model for Rab proteins’ interaction in RPE. Our results suggest that Rab10 and Rab14
might influence Rab8 in a negative feedback mechanism, important for controlling VEGF
secretion. Our achievements’ unravel Rab proteins’ role in VEGF secretion by RPE cells and are the basis for future studies to better understand RPE molecular secretory machinery"
0,Protein expression reveals a molecular sexual identity of avian primordial germ cells at pre-gonadal stages,https://core.ac.uk/works/9028050,"International audienceIn poultry, in vitro propagated primordial germ cells (PGCs) represent an important tool for the cryopreservation of avian genetic resources. However, several studies have highlighted sexual differences exhibited by PGCs during in vitro propagation, which may compromise their reproductive capacities. To understand this phenomenon, we compared the proteome of pregonadal migratory male (ZZ) and female (ZW) chicken PGCs propagated in vitro by quantitative proteomic analysis using a GeLC-MS/MS strategy. Many proteins were found to be differentially abundant in chicken male and female PGCs indicating their early sexual identity. Many of the proteins more highly expressed in male PGCs were encoded by genes localised to the Z sex chromosome. This suggests that the known lack of dosage compensation of the transcription of Z-linked genes between sexes persists at the protein level in PGCs, and that this may be a key factor of their autonomous sex differentiation. We also found that globally, protein differences do not closely correlate with transcript differences indicating a selective translational mechanism in PGCs. Male and female PGC expressed protein sets were associated with differential biological processes and contained proteins known to be biologically relevant for male and female germ cell development, respectively. We also discovered that female PGCs have a higher capacity to uptake proteins from the cell culture medium than male PGCs. This study presents the first evidence of an early predetermined sex specific cell fate of chicken PGCs and their sexual molecular specificities which will enable the development of more precise sex-specific in vitro culture conditions for the preservation of avian genetic resources"
1,The RpL13a snoRNA U33 Forms Novel snoRNPs During Lipotoxicity,https://core.ac.uk/works/69666139,"Lipid overload contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, causing tissue damage and cell death in a number of organ systems. This process is termed lipotoxicity. Animal and cell culture studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress are major pathways engaged in the lipotoxic response. However, the molecular mechanisms of lipotoxicity are not well understood. A genetic screen revealed that small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) encoded in the introns of the Rpl13a locus are critical for cell death in response to lipotoxicity. Initial studies have suggested that the Rpl13a snoRNAs function in this pathway through non-canonical modes of action, involving trafficking to the cytoplasm.To gain insight into the mechanism of action of Rpl13a snoRNA U33, snoRNPs were isolated from cells. We observed many previously undescribed snoRNA-interacting proteins in whole cell lysates. Identification of proteins that co-precipitate from cytosolic and post-cytosolic lysates, under lipotoxic stress and basal conditions, demonstrated that U33-containing complexes are dynamic, and the composition of these complexes depends on both subcellular localization and the presence or absence of stress. We hypothesized that Rpl13a snoRNAs may direct modification of cytosolic mRNAs to affect their abundance or translation efficiency. Consistent with this model, RNA-seq analysis identified over 200 transcripts with significant changes in abundance under lipotoxic conditions. Metabolic labeling revealed that many of these changes are due, at least in part, to changes in transcript stability. Furthermore, ribosome footprinting indicated that a number of transcripts are differentially translated during lipotoxicity. Together, these studies add to a growing body of evidence that snoRNAs function in roles beyond the processing and modification of ribosomal RNAs"
2,A computational approach to candidate gene prioritization for X-linked mental retardation using annotation-based binary filtering and motif-based linear discriminatory analysis,https://core.ac.uk/works/3954054,"<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>Several computational candidate gene selection and prioritization methods have recently been developed. These <it>in silico </it>selection and prioritization techniques are usually based on two central approaches - the examination of similarities to known disease genes and/or the evaluation of functional annotation of genes. Each of these approaches has its own caveats. Here we employ a previously described method of candidate gene prioritization based mainly on gene annotation, in accompaniment with a technique based on the evaluation of pertinent sequence motifs or signatures, in an attempt to refine the gene prioritization approach. We apply this approach to X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), a group of heterogeneous disorders for which some of the underlying genetics is known.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>The gene annotation-based binary filtering method yielded a ranked list of putative XLMR candidate genes with good plausibility of being associated with the development of mental retardation. In parallel, a motif finding approach based on linear discriminatory analysis (LDA) was employed to identify short sequence patterns that may discriminate XLMR from non-XLMR genes. High rates (>80%) of correct classification was achieved, suggesting that the identification of these motifs effectively captures genomic signals associated with XLMR vs. non-XLMR genes. The computational tools developed for the motif-based LDA is integrated into the freely available genomic analysis portal Galaxy (<url>http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/</url>).

3,Toxicogenomics of Bisphenol A and Neurodevelopmental Disorders,https://core.ac.uk/works/10962307,"Bisphenol A (BPA) has been widely used in many industrial and consumer products and is known as an endocrine‐disrupting chemical. To find the underlying genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of BPA‐associated neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs), this chapter addressed the toxicogenomics of BPA with publicly accessed Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. The present results indicated that the key cellular components (CC) of the nervous system such as neuron, synapse, dendrite and axon are common in CC annotation; the commonly found molecular functions are neurotransmitter receptor or transducer binding or activity; and the main common biological processes include synaptic signalling, cognition, learning or memory, behaviour, the development of nervous system and brain. Neuroactive ligand‐receptor interaction, dopaminergic, glutamatergic and serotonergic synapses, monoamine transport and synaptic vesicle pathway were the common pathways. Simultaneously, the BPA-disease may share the common pathways with drug addictions such as cocaine addiction. Unique pathways might also contribute to the BPA action in different NDs such as one carbon metabolism and detoxification of oxidative stress in Down syndrome. Although GO and pathway results indicate some common annotations, the predicted PPI molecular function clusters are quite different for each ND. In addition, some of the NDs share the same transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs, which indicate these disorders have the similar expression profiles. Finally, chemicals having comparable interacting genes to BPA should be considered"
4,Myelin Proteomics: Molecular Anatomy of an Insulating Sheath,https://core.ac.uk/works/3741650,"Fast-transmitting vertebrate axons are electrically insulated with multiple layers of nonconductive plasma membrane of glial cell origin, termed myelin. The myelin membrane is dominated by lipids, and its protein composition has historically been viewed to be of very low complexity. In this review, we discuss an updated reference compendium of 342 proteins associated with central nervous system myelin that represents a valuable resource for analyzing myelin biogenesis and white matter homeostasis. Cataloging the myelin proteome has been made possible by technical advances in the separation and mass spectrometric detection of proteins, also referred to as proteomics. This led to the identification of a large number of novel myelin-associated proteins, many of which represent low abundant components involved in catalytic activities, the cytoskeleton, vesicular trafficking, or cell adhesion. By mass spectrometry-based quantification, proteolipid protein and myelin basic protein constitute 17% and 8% of total myelin protein, respectively, suggesting that their abundance was previously overestimated. As the biochemical profile of myelin-associated proteins is highly reproducible, differential proteome analyses can be applied to material isolated from patients or animal models of myelin-related diseases such as multiple sclerosis and leukodystrophies"
5,Cellular and molecular characterization of multiplex autism in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons,https://core.ac.uk/works/40439592,"Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with pronounced heritability in the general population. This is largely attributable to the effects of polygenic susceptibility, with inherited liability exhibiting distinct sex differences in phenotypic expression. Attempts to model ASD in human cellular systems have principally involved rare de novo mutations associated with ASD phenocopies. However, by definition, these models are not representative of polygenic liability, which accounts for the vast share of population-attributable risk.
Methods: Here, we performed what is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to model multiplex autism using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in a family manifesting incremental degrees of phenotypic expression of inherited liability (absent, intermediate, severe). The family members share an inherited variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in
Results: cExN neurospheres from the two affected individuals were reduced in size, compared to those derived from unaffected related and unrelated individuals. This reduction was, at least in part, due to increased apoptosis of cells from affected individuals upon initiation of cExN neural induction. Likewise, cIN neural progenitor cells from affected individuals exhibited increased apoptosis, compared to both unaffected individuals. Transcriptomic analysis of both cExN and cIN neural progenitor cells revealed distinct molecular signatures associated with affectation, including the misregulation of suites of genes associated with neural development, neuronal function, and behavior, as well as altered expression of ASD risk-associated genes.
Conclusions: We have provided evidence of morphological, physiological, and transcriptomic signatures of polygenic liability to ASD from an analysis of cellular models derived from a multiplex autism family. ASD is commonly inherited on the basis of additive genetic liability. Therefore, identifying convergent cellular and molecular phenotypes resulting from polygenic and monogenic susceptibility may provide a critical bridge for determining which of the disparate effects of rare highly deleterious mutations might also apply to common autistic syndromes"
6,Molecular mechanisms of acquired gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer,https://core.ac.uk/works/43411936,"Indiana University-Purdue University (IUPUI)Most pancreatic cancer patients receiving gemcitabine chemotherapy eventually develop resistance to gemcitabine. To improve survival and prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients, better understanding the mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance and discovery of new therapeutic targets are required. In this study, I investigated the molecular mechanisms of acquired gemcitabine resistance using a stepwise gemcitabine-selected pancreatic cancer cell line in comparison to the parental cell line. I found that 14-3-3&#963; is up-regulated in the drug resistant cell line due to demethylation in its first exon, and the up-regulation of 14-3-3&#963; gene expression, in turn, contributes to gemcitabine resistance. Intriguingly, I found that demethylation of the 14-3-3&#963; gene in gemcitabine resistant cells is reversibly regulated by DNMT1 and UHRF1. Furthermore, I found that 14-3-3&#963; over-expression causes gemcitabine resistance by inhibiting gemcitabine-induced apoptosis and caspase-8 activation possibly via binding to YAP1. The finding of demethylation of the 14-3-3&#963; gene in gemcitabine resistant cells led to a hypothesis that other genes may also be changed epigenetically following gemcitabine selection. By RRBS (Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing) analysis, 845 genes were found to have altered methylation. One of these genes, PDGFD, was further investigated and found to have reversible demethylation at its promoter region in the drug resistant cells and contribute to gemcitabine resistance possibly via autocrine activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. Together, these findings not only provide evidence that 14-3-3&#963; and PDGFD over-expression contribute to acquired gemcitabine resistance and that reversible epigenetic changes may play an important role in acquired gemcitabine resistance, but also demonstrate that the molecular mechanisms of acquired gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer cells are complex and multifaceted"
7,Characterization of the Deleted in Autism 1 Protein Family: Implications for Studying Cognitive Disorders,https://core.ac.uk/works/3887617,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of commonly occurring, highly-heritable developmental disabilities. Human genes c3orf58 or Deleted In Autism-1 (DIA1) and cXorf36 or Deleted in Autism-1 Related (DIA1R) are implicated in ASD and mental retardation. Both gene products encode signal peptides for targeting to the secretory pathway. As evolutionary medicine has emerged as a key tool for understanding increasing numbers of human diseases, we have used an evolutionary approach to study DIA1 and DIA1R. We found DIA1 conserved from cnidarians to humans, indicating DIA1 evolution coincided with the development of the first primitive synapses. Nematodes lack a DIA1 homologue, indicating Caenorhabditis elegans is not suitable for studying all aspects of ASD etiology, while zebrafish encode two DIA1 paralogues. By contrast to DIA1, DIA1R was found exclusively in vertebrates, with an origin coinciding with the whole-genome duplication events occurring early in the vertebrate lineage, and the evolution of the more complex vertebrate nervous system. Strikingly, DIA1R was present in schooling fish but absent in fish that have adopted a more solitary lifestyle. An additional DIA1-related gene we named DIA1-Like (DIA1L), lacks a signal peptide and is restricted to the genomes of the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae. Evidence for remarkable DIA1L gene expansion was found in B. floridae. Amino acid alignments of DIA1 family gene products revealed a potential Golgi-retention motif and a number of conserved motifs with unknown function. Furthermore, a glycine and three cysteine residues were absolutely conserved in all DIA1-family proteins, indicating a critical role in protein structure and/or function. We have therefore identified a new metazoan protein family, the DIA1-family, and understanding the biological roles of DIA1-family members will have implications for our understanding of autism and mental retardation"
8,B Cell Activation and Antibody Responses: The role of vesicle trafficking and Rab GTPases,https://core.ac.uk/works/126178702,"B lymphocytes are an important part of the adaptive immune system. As one of their main functions, B cells can recognise specific antigens via their B cell receptor and produce antibodies that help clear infections. In T-dependent antibody responses, B cells need to uptake protein antigens and degrade them in specialised and highly regulated intracellular vesicles. The resulting peptides will be loaded onto the Major Histocompatibility Complex II (MHCII) and presented to the T lymphocytes to fully activate the immune response. Hence, precise coordination of vesicular trafficking is essential for antigen processing and presentation. However, how these processes are coordinated remains poorly understood.

This thesis focused on the characterisation of the antigen processing routes in B lymphocytes and the role of the small GTPase Rab8a, a vesicle regulator, in the B cell immune response. First, we followed the traffic of the antigen in mouse B cells and studied its colocalisation with different endosomal markers using high-end microscopy. This allowed us to identify a population of highly dynamic and heterogenous vesicles with degradative capacity. These vesicles, termed early MHCII compartments (eMIIC), also contained MHC II internalised from the cell surface and its chaperone H2-M, indicating that eMIIC could readily process and present uptaken antigens with remarkable efficiency. Second, we developed a specific hybridisation internalisation probe (SHIP) assay that allowed for the precise imaging of internalised antigen in B lymphocytes. Third, we investigated the role of Rab8a in B cell biology for the first time using conditional Rab8a knock out mice. Interestingly, despite of its localization to antigen vesicles, Rab8a deficiency did not alter antigen internalisation, processing or presentation. Instead, it caused increased antibody responses in vivo. Our work demonstrates that Rab8a regulates the antibody responses, although the molecular mechanisms remain to be discovered. Overall, this thesis contributes to the understanding of the antigen processing route and the role of an uncharacterised Rab GTPase, Rab8a, in B lymphocytes.B-soluaktivaatio ja vasta-ainereaktio –Kalvorakkulaliikenteen ja Rab GTPaasien rooli

B-(lymfosyytti)soluilla on tärkeä tehtävä elimistön mukautuvan immuunijärjestelmän toiminnassa. B-solujen yhtenä päätehtävänä on tunnistaa spesifisiä antigeenejä B‑solureseptoriensa (BCR) avulla ja tuottaa vasta-aineita, jotka auttavat parantamaan infektioita. T-soluvälitteisissä vasta-ainereaktioissa B-solut ottavat sisäänsä proteiiniantigeenin ja hajottavat sen erikoistuneissa ja tarkoin säädellyissä solunsisäisissä kalvorakkuloissa. Prosessissa syntyvät peptidit ladataan MHCIIkomplekseihin ja esitellään T-soluille täyden immuunivasteen aktivoimiseksi. Siten kalvorakkulaliikenteen tarkalla säätelyllä on merkittävä rooli antigeenin prosessoinnissa ja esittelyssä. Mekanismeja, joiden avulla näitä tapahtumasarjoja Bsoluissa säädellään, tunnetaan kuitenkin tällä hetkellä huonosti.

Tämä työ keskittyi karakterisoimaan antigeenin prosessointireittejä B-soluissa sekä selvittämään Rab8-kalvorakkulasäätelijän roolia B-soluvälitteisessä immuunipuolustuksessa. Aluksi seurasimme antigeenin ottamista solun sisälle ja sen paikallistumista erilaisiin kalvorakkuloihin moderneja kuvantamistyökaluja käyttäen. Identifioimme antigeenin erittäin dynaamisissa ja heterogeenisissä kalvorakkuloissa, joilla oli kapasiteettia myös antigeenin hajottamiseen. Nämä nopeasti muodostuvat kalvorakkulat sisälsivät myös solun pinnalta tulleita MHCII komplekseja, sekä MHCII kompleksin tarvitsemaa esiliina-proteiinia H2-M; tämä tulos viittaa näiden kalvorakkuloiden mahdollisuuteen prosessoida antigeenia esiteltäväksi hyvin nopeasti. Toisessa työssä kehitimme hybridisoituvaa internalisaatio-koetinta käyttävän protokollan, jonka avulla voidaan poistaa solun pinnalla olevan antigeenin taustasignaali ja täten kuvantaa ainoastaan solun sisälle otettua antigeenia. Lopuksi tutkimme Rab8-proteiinin roolia B-soluissa käyttäen konditionaalista Rab8a-poistogeenistä hiirimallia. Työn tulokset osoittivat, että Rab8a lokalisoitui antigeenia sisältäviin kalvorakkuloihin mutta sen puute ei vaikuttanut antigeenin sisään ottamiseen, prosessointiin tai esittelyyn. Sen sijaan Rab8a:n puuttuminen B-soluista lisäsi hiirissä muodostuvaa vasta-ainereaktiota. Työmme osoitti, että Rab8a kontrolloi vasta-ainetuotantoa, mutta molekyylitason mekanismien selvittäminen vaatii vielä lisätutkimuksia. Tämä lopputyö laajentaa ymmärrystämme antigeenien prosessointireiteistä B-soluissa sekä aiemmin karakterisoimattoman Rab GTPaasin, Rab8a:n, roolista"
0,Evolutionary and Developmental Survey of Genes Involved in Chordate Pigmentation,https://core.ac.uk/works/8055524,"The pigmentation represents one of the most interesting topics in animal life because it is a decisive factor for the evolutionary success and the conquest of new ecological niches. Through the combination of developmental biology and comparative genomics, some aspects of pigmentary dynamics have been studied.



Given Rabs regulate a plethora of trafficking steps, the members belonging to this family are central to the transport of molecules involved in pigmentation. Moreover, comprehending the evolution of Rab family is relevant to understand the establishment of eukaryotic cellular organization and for its implication in many human pathologies. For the first time, I reconstructed the evolutionary scenario of Rab family in eleven species of metazoans, spanning from cnidarians to human. Phylogeny, intron code and synteny conservation prompted me to depict Rab evolution, with a special focus on chordates that exhibit a highly dynamic evolutionary pattern.



I clarified the evolution of Rab32/38 subfamily, fundamental in regulation of trafficking related to melanogenesis. It has been clarified the evolutionary history of Rab32/38 genes in deuterostomes and the expression pattern in key species as zebrafish and amphioxus, demonstrating how events as whole-genome duplications have influenced their role during embryogenesis.



In order to find new genes involved in pigmentation, I analyzed a Kelch-like member in ascidian Ciona robusta (Cr-Klhl21). My results point at this gene as a marker of pigmented cells, with a dynamic expression profile during embryogenesis: from middle tailbud stage, it is expressed specifically in the otolith. Moreover, Cr-Klhl21 shows an intricate regulatory scenario with the possible intervention of a transcription factors combination (Cr-Mitf, Cr-msxb, Cr-Dmrt). This work contains first data about a Kelch-like member in ascidians, providing new insights in pigmentation or pigment cell specification. This encourages further analyses on its gene regulatory network and possible function"
1,A relevância da sinalização da insulina na doença de Alzheimer,https://core.ac.uk/works/11569974,"Mestrado em Biologia Molecular e CelularAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia worldwide. It is molecularly characterized by deposition of extracellular senile plaques (SPs) composed by aggregated amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) derived from hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau, synaptic dysfunction due to the deposits of SPs and NFTs and oxidative stress induced by impaired metabolic pathways.
The insulin signalling pathway can play a major role in diverse AD related pathways, such as APP cleavage, Tau hyperphosphorylation, Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) influence in insulin signalling efficiency and the insulin degrading enzyme, which is also the major Aβ degrading enzyme.
Growing evidence links AD with type 2 diabetes (T2D) due to impaired insulin signalling (IS) and brain insulin resistance. In a cohort based study in the Aveiro region, a correlation between diabetes and poor cognitive scores in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) test were observed, with a p-value of 0.072. Additionally, carriers of the allele ApoE-ɛ2 appeared to be protective against diabetes, in the literature the same allele appears to be protective for AD.
Posteriorly, the analysis of protein interactions, via the development of interactome networks, identified several proteins involved in both AD and the IS pathways. Also, by correlating these pathways with the synapse proteome, a very high overlap was observed (88% for AD, 79% for IS and 96% for AD and IS coincident proteins), enforcing the importance of both pathways in synaptic signalling and plasticity. From gene ontology studies, it was possible to assess the principal biological processes and molecular functions of the dataset of proteins. For AD, response to stimulus, cellular component organization, cell communication, signalling, protein binding, receptor binding and kinase binding were categories with elevated representation. Regarding coincident proteins between AD and IS pathways, an increase in all categories was observed, meaning that insulin plays a pivotal role in many AD events.
Finally, the analysis of SH-SY5Y differentiated cells treated with 0, 1, 10 and 100 nM of insulin for 0, 10 and 60 minutes, showed a decrease on the intracellular total levels of protein Tau and an increase in the phosphorylation at serine 396. Regarding the amyloid precursor protein (APP), increases in intracellular levels were observed, when treated with insulin for 10 minutes, followed by a decrease for 60 minutes exposure. The phosphorylation of APP at threonine 668, has previously been related to increased production of Aβ, by promoting APP cleavage via the amyloidogenic pathway. In cells treated with insulin, a clear increase was detected at the 10-minute time point. At 60 minutes, the levels of phosphorylation were low probably due to low total APP levels.A doença de Alzheimer (DA) é o tipo mais comum de demência no mundo. É caracterizada molecularmente pela deposição extracelular de placas senis (PS) compostas por agregados do péptido amiloide beta (Aβ), pela formação de emaranhados neurofibrilares (EN) derivados da hiperfosforilação da proteína Tau, pela disfunção sináptica devido aos depósitos de PS e EN e também pelo stress oxidativo induzido pelo enfraquecimento das vias metabólicas.
A via de sinalização da insulina desempenha um papel principal em diversas vias da DA, tal como na clivagem da APP, hiperfosforilação da proteína Tau, eficiência da sinalização da insulina influenciada pela Apolipoproteína E (ApoE) e pela enzima envolvida na degradação de insulina que também é a enzima principal na degradação de Aβ.
Crescente evidência relaciona a DA com a diabetes de tipo 2 (T2D) devido ao mau funcionamento da sinalização pela insulina e da resistência cerebral à mesma. Num estudo baseado num cohort da região de Aveiro, foi observada uma correlação entre a diabetes e um mau resultado no teste do ‘Mini Mental State Examination’. Adicionalmente, também foi observada uma correlação entre os portadores do alelo ApoE-ɛ2 e um estado protetor contra a T2D. Este alelo também foi observado na literatura como sendo protetor contra a DA.
Posteriormente, uma análise de interações entre proteínas, identificou várias proteínas envolvidas tanto na DA como na sinalização da insulina. Correlacionando estes dados com o proteoma da sinapse, foi possível observar que existe uma grande representação das duas condições e também das proteínas coincidentes às duas (88% para a DA, 79% para a sinalização da insulina e 96% para as proteínas relacionadas com ambas), reforçando o papel de ambas as vias na sinalização e plasticidade sináptica. Do estudo de ontologia genética para a DA, foi possível identificar diversas vias importantes, tais como, resposta a um estímulo, organização de componentes celulares, comunicação celular, ligação proteica e ligação a uma cinase. Em relação à sinalização da insulina, as mesmas categorias apareciam com maior representação, significando que a insulina tem um papel importante em muitos eventos da DA.
Por fim, o tratamento de SH-SY5Y diferenciadas com 0, 1, 10 e 100 nM de insulina por 0, 10 e 60 minutos mostraram uma diminuição nos níveis intracelulares da proteína Tau e um aumento na sua fosforilação na serina 396. Em relação à proteína percursora amiloide (APP), o tratamento de insulina levou a um aumento nos níveis intracelulares, quando exposta por 10 minutos seguido por uma diminuição aos 60 minutos. Quanto à fosforilação da treonina 668 da APP, foi previamente demonstrado que um aumento na fosforilação desse resíduo, promove a clivagem pela via amiloidogénica, levando à produção de Aβ. Nas células tratadas com insulina, um aumento claro da fosforilação desse resíduo da APP foi observado aos 10 minutos. Aos 60 minutos, os níveis da fosforilação eram baixos provavelmente devido aos baixos níveis de APP total"

the adult cohort has common features, which are significantly recurrent comparing to
EGC UT general population. Also, a new approach was used for finding genetic
modifiers contributing to the variability of genomic disorders phenotypes. The wholeexome
analysis found potential modifying substitutions for 4 adult 16p11.2 CNV

3,Global gene expression profiling of healthy human brain and its application in studying neurological disorders,https://core.ac.uk/works/74799139,"The human brain is the most complex structure known to mankind and one of the greatest challenges in modern biology is to understand how it is built and organized. The power of the brain arises from its variety of cells and structures, and ultimately where and when different genes are switched on and off throughout the brain tissue. In other words, brain function depends on the precise regulation of gene expression in its sub-anatomical structures. But, our understanding of the complexity and dynamics of the transcriptome of the human brain is still incomplete. To fill in the need, we designed a gene expression model that accurately defines the consistent blueprint of the brain transcriptome; thereby, identifying the core brain specific transcriptional processes conserved across individuals. Functionally characterizing this model would provide profound insights into the transcriptional landscape, biological pathways and the expression distribution of neurotransmitter systems.
Here, in this dissertation we developed an expression model by capturing the similarly expressed gene patterns across congruently annotated brain structures in six individual brains by using data from the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA). We found that 84% of genes are expressed in at least one of the 190 brain structures. By employing hierarchical clustering we were able to show that distinct structures of a bigger brain region can cluster together while still retaining their expression identity. Further, weighted correlation network analysis identified 19 robust modules of coexpressing genes in the brain that demonstrated a wide range of functional associations. Since signatures of local phenomena can be masked by larger signatures, we performed local analysis on each distinct brain structure. Pathway and gene ontology enrichment analysis on these structures showed, striking enrichment for brain region specific processes. Besides, we also mapped the structural distribution of the gene expression profiles of genes associated with major neurotransmission systems in the human. We also postulated the utility of healthy brain tissue gene expression to predict potential genes involved in a neurological disorder, in the absence of data from diseased tissues. To this end, we developed a supervised classification model, which achieved an accuracy of 84% and an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.81 from ROC plots, for predicting autism-implicated genes using the healthy expression model as the baseline. This study represents the first use of healthy brain gene expression to predict the scope of genes in autism implication and this generic methodology can be applied to predict genes involved in other neurological disorders"
4,Utilizing Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification to Detect Novel X-linked Microduplications Which Cause Intellectual Disability,https://core.ac.uk/works/75063234,"ABSTRACT       A number of conditions related to X-linked intellectual disabilities (XLID) are in part due to microduplications that are not visible cytogenetically. With the focus on Rho, Ras and Rab genes, a family of genes known to be associated with intellectual disabilities, were screened for dosage aberrations (Leeuwen, F. N. 1997), (Ng, E. L. 2008), (Gissen, P. 2007), (Gurkan, C. 2005). Cohorts of intellectually disabled ID individuals were explored with new technologies.  These new technologies include comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Madrigal, I. 2007), (Hermsen, M. A. 2005), (Morey, J. S. 2006).         The first screening was of two groups of individuals, one group with hypotonia and varying degrees of ID and the other of individuals with nonsyndromic ID and a suspected X-linked etiology. These cohorts were screened using the Mental Retardation on the X chromosome (MRX) kit, which focuses on genes that cause intellectual disability and are located on the X chromosome. The second screening consisted of the two former groups and 5 additional cohorts totaling 1152 patients, using a synthetic probe kit that was designed to target primarily Ras, Rab and Rho X-linked genes that were not covered by the MRX kit. The 5 additional cohorts were individuals that had normal sequencing results for one of the following X-linked genes XNP, L1CAM, UBE3A, FGD1, and STK9.         The MRX screening produced a GDI1 duplication, deletion in FACL4 and an FMR2 missense mutation (c.474C\u3eT).   The synthetic MLPA screening found a partial XNP duplication (248kb), a 1p36 duplication/deletion complex rearrangement and a greater than 3Mb 1p36 deletion. It has been concluded from this study that duplications in these genes are rare, appearing in less than 1% in these chosen populations.       Another section of this project is the characterization of a 275kb Xq25 duplication found during routine MLPA testing for MECP2. An Xq25 control peak on the MRC Holland MECP2 MLPA revealed a duplication in a female that presented with a MECP2 phenotype (Chahrour, M. 2007).  This duplication spanned four genes (AIF, ELF4, BCORL1 and RAB33A) and of these four, two were over-expressed (AIF and RAB33A). Using qPCR to look for the link that may cause the similar phenotype to Rett syndrome in this patient, 26 Ras, Rab and Rho genes were tested in patients with Rett syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, ID with unknown etiology and the Xq25 patient. A similar pattern of expression was seen in this small cohort with ID. The CREB1 gene, the co-activator of MECP2, part of the transcription factor complex for 21 of the 26 genes screened, plays a role in all of these conditions and may be the linking factor in producing these patterns. The over expression of the AIF gene seemed to play a role in the mis-regulation of many genes, but with uncertainty on how it led to any affect on the phenotype.        In this study duplications that play a role in the causation of ID were found using MLPA technology. As array CGH becomes more refined, with higher coverage and better software, the finding of microduplications that cause ID will increase"
5,Pathogenic Huntingtin Repeat Expansions in Patients with Frontotemporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,https://core.ac.uk/works/106200019,"We examined the role of repeat expansions in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by analyzing whole-genome sequence data from 2,442 FTD/ALS patients, 2,599 Lewy body dementia (LBD) patients, and 3,158 neurologically healthy subjects. Pathogenic expansions (range, 40-64 CAG repeats) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene were found in three (0.12%) patients diagnosed with pure FTD/ALS syndromes but were not present in the LBD or healthy cohorts. We replicated our findings in an independent collection of 3,674 FTD/ALS patients. Postmortem evaluations of two patients revealed the classical TDP-43 pathology of FTD/ALS, as well as huntingtin-positive, ubiquitin-positive aggregates in the frontal cortex. The neostriatal atrophy that pathologically defines Huntington's disease was absent in both cases. Our findings reveal an etiological relationship between HTT repeat expansions and FTD/ALS syndromes and indicate that genetic screening of FTD/ALS patients for HTT repeat expansions should be considered"

Resnick,32 We examined the role of repeat expansions in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by analyzing whole-genome sequence data from 2,442 FTD/ALS patients, 2,599 Lewy body dementia (LBD) patients, and 3,158 neurologically healthy subjects. Pathogenic expansions (range, 40?64 CAG repeats) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene were found in three (0.12%) patients diagnosed with pure FTD/ALS syndromes but were not present in the LBD or healthy cohorts. We replicated our findings in an independent collection of 3,674 FTD/ALS patients. Postmortem evaluations of two patients revealed the classical TDP-43 pathology of FTD/ALS, as well as huntingtin-positive, ubiquitin-positive aggregates in the frontal cortex. The neostriatal atrophy that pathologically defines Huntington?s disease was absent in both cases. Our findings reveal an etiological relationship between HTT repeat expansions and FTD/ALS syndromes and indicate that genetic screening of FTD/ALS patients for HTT repeat expansions should be considered.

7,Poly-GA triggers TDP-43 pathology by inhibiting the proteasome and nucleocytoplasmic import in C9orf72 ALS/FTD,https://core.ac.uk/works/23009701,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are two fatal neurodegenerative disorders that share overlapping clinical and pathological features (Kato, Hayashi et al. 1993, Lomen-Hoerth, Anderson et al. 2002). Although both diseases occur mostly sporadically, several disease-associated mutations have been identified in >25 different genes, many of which are encoding RNA binding proteins (RBP), components of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), and the autophagy pathway (Kapeli, Martinez et al. 2017, Bartoletti, Bosco et al. 2019). Cytoplasmic  inclusions of the multifunctional RNA-binding protein TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein) that normally resides predominantly in the nucleus are found in ~90% of ALS and ~45% of FTD cases. TDP-43 dyshomeostasis including aberrations in its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and aggregation has been shown to induce toxicity, explaining a crucial role in the process of neurodegeneration (Araki, Minegishi et al. 2014, Leibiger, Deisel et al. 2018, Prasad, Bharathi et al. 2019). 



The most common pathogenic mutation found in ~10% of ALS/FTLD patients is the massive expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat (G4C2)n in the first intron of C9orf72 gene (DeJesus-Hernandez, Mackenzie et al. 2011, Renton, Majounie et al. 2011). C9orf72 patients show, in addition to typical TDP-43 pathology, nuclear RNA foci containing the repeat RNA from both sense and antisense transcripts (DeJesus-Hernandez, Mackenzie et al. 2011) and unique inclusions of five different species of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins (poly-GA/-GP/-GR/-PA and -PR). DPR inclusions are derived from an unconventional non-AUG translation of the intronic repeat RNA in all reading frames (Ash, Bieniek et al. 2013, Gendron, Bieniek et al. 2013, Mori, Arzberger et al. 2013, Mori, Weng et al. 2013, Zu, Liu et al. 2013). Nearly all inclusions are poly-GA positive and often contain also poly-GP/-GR and far less frequently poly-PA/-PR. In vitro, poly-GA sequesters large amounts of stalled proteasomes suggesting a deleterious effect on cellular proteostasis (Guo, Lehmer et al. 2018). DPR pathology has been shown to precede TDP-43 pathology in patients, thereby considered as a major driver of neurodegeneration associated with C9ORF72 expansion (Baborie et al. 2015; Mann 2015; Mori, Arzberger, et al. 2013; Mori, Weng, et al. 2013; Proudfoot et al. 2014). How C9orf72‐specific pathology triggers TDP‐43 pathology, despite not being spatially correlated in human studies (Schludi et al. 2017), was the primary objective of my PhD studies. 



When I started my PhD project, several groups reported impaired global nucleocytoplasmic transport possibly through a direct effect on the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in different C9orf72 models and connected it to poly-GR/PR (Jovicic, Mertens et al. 2015), repeat RNA (Zhang, Donnelly et al. 2015), or both (Freibaum, Lu et al. 2015), however in these studies trafficking of TDP-43 itself was not analyzed. Furthermore, artificial aggregating β-sheet proteins were shown to inhibit nucleocytoplasmic transport related to sequestration of the THOC complex and RNA binding proteins (Woerner, Frottin et al. 2016). Since GA15 peptides, but not 15-mers of the other DPR species, form amyloid-like fibrils (Chang, Jeng et al. 2016), I asked whether poly-GA may also impair nucleocytoplasmic transport. I therefore compared the impact of individual expression of poly-GA, poly-GR and poly-PR on the nuclear import, specifically of TDP-43 to understand the link between the C9orf72 mutation and TDP-43 pathology. I quantitatively analyzed cytoplasmic mislocalization of endogenous TDP-43 and of a reporter containing the established bipartite classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) of TDP-43. Interestingly, poly-GA blocked nuclear import of TDP-43 more robustly than poly-GR/PR, while none of the DPR proteins affected the localization of a reporter containing a transportin-dependent PY-NLS in our in vitro models arguing DPR proteins mainly impair nuclear transport through the classical importin α/β pathway mediating TDP-43 import. In addition, I found that overexpression of two NPC components (NUP54 and NUP62) can fully rescue nuclear localization of the TDP-43 reporter. NUP54 and NUP62 were interestingly shown to be essential for nuclear import of TDP-43 (Nishimura, Zupunski et al. 2010) and NUP62 knockdown enhances (PR)25 toxicity in flies (Boeynaems, Bogaert et al. 2016). Thus, inhibition of nuclear import of TDP-43 by poly-GA may link the C9orf72 mutation to TDP-43 pathology in C9orf72 ALS/FTD cases. 



Since poly-GA precedes symptom onset by many years (Vatsavayai, Yoon et al. 2016) and rarely co-localize with TDP-43 inclusions, chronic toxicity and possibly non‐cell‐autonomous effects were proposed (Edbauer and Haass 2016). For example, cell‐to‐cell transmission of cytoplasmic Tau and α‐synuclein aggregates results in stereotypic spreading during the progression of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, respectively (Jucker and Walker 2018). Thus, I analyzed non‐cell‐autonomous effects of DPRs as a potential trigger of TDP‐43 pathology using co‐culture assays and antibody treatment experiments to inhibit poly-GA cell‐ to‐cell transmission. Importantly, I discovered that poly‐GA transmission inhibits the proteasome even in neighboring cells. Activating the proteasome pharmacologically (with the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram) or genetically (using PSMD11 overexpression) rescues nuclear import of the TDP‐43 NLS reporter. Therefore, I hypothesized that poly‐GA inclusions may block the import of TDP‐43 via ubiquitination directly within its NLS, which accumulate through impaired proteostasis. I could show that mutagenizing lysine 95 in the NLS largely prevents ubiquitination of TDP-43 and did not impair basal nuclear import, but completely prevented poly-GA mediated inhibition of TDP-43 import. In contrast, mutation of lysine 84 severely blocks interactions with nuclear import receptors such as importin‐α5/KPNA1, independent of poly-GA expression, which is in consistence with previous reports (Hans, Eckert et al. 2018). Importantly, poly-GA antibodies reduce poly-GA transmission and cytoplasmic TDP-43 mislocalization in HeLa cells and primary neurons, suggesting poly-GA antibodies could be potentially used to treat C9orf72 ALS/FTD.



Taken together, my work shows that poly-GA promotes cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43 cell- and non-cell-autonomously due to impaired proteasomal clearance of TDP-43 ubiquitinated within its NLS at lysine 95. My work also indicates that pharmacologically boosting proteasome activity (e.g. by rolipram) or inhibiting poly-GA transmission using antibodies are promising therapeutic approaches for C9orf72 ALS/FTD. Indeed, our group (Zhou, Mareljic et al. 2020) and others (Nguyen, Montrasio et al. 2020) have reported promising results using anti-GA antibodies or vaccination in mouse models confirming my data in vivo"
8,Identifying modifiers of age‐dependent protein aggregation in C. elegans,https://core.ac.uk/works/45299020,"The misfolding of specific proteins and their accumulation in insoluble aggregates has long been recognized as a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years, widespread protein aggregation occurring during healthy aging has become a hot topic of research. However, to this date little is known about the regulation of this aggregation, the tissue‐specificity and the consequences in a disease context. This thesis answers several questions about different aspects of protein aggregation with aging and in disease. Notably, we analysed the solubility of RNA‐binding proteins that are important for the formation of stress granules (sgRBPs) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). We showed the impact of sgRBP insolubility on organismal health and the importance of maintaining their solubility in long‐lived animals. We identified regulators of sgRBP aggregation. In addition, we showed that aggregation‐prone sgRBPs are highly prone to interact with other proteins and that this co‐localization can influence aggregation patterns or protein localization. Furthermore, we analysed the tissue‐specificity of the regulation of age‐related protein aggregation. Disruption of the protein‐quality control network has contrasting effects on protein aggregation in different tissues, surprisingly reducing age‐related protein aggregation in the pharyngeal muscle of C. elegans. Specifically, we showed that impaired proteinquality control prevented the accumulation of newly synthesized aggregation‐prone proteins. Additionally we demonstrated how screening approaches identifying mutations that influence disease‐associated phenotypes, like protein aggregation in C. elegans, can help prioritise variants found by whole exome sequencing in large cohorts of patients with Parkinson’s disease. To validate promising candidates found to be influencing protein aggregation in C. elegans, we have established a cell culture model of age‐related protein aggregation. In conclusion, these findings give important insights into mechanism and regulation of age‐related protein insolubility and highlight the importance of age‐related protein aggregation for neurodegenerative diseases"
0,Defining the mechanisms of neutrophil exocytosis using proteomic techniques.,https://core.ac.uk/works/46387123,"Exocytosis of intracellular granules is critical for conversion of inactive, circulating neutrophils to fully activated cells. The p38 MAPK pathway plays a central role in neutrophil exocytosis, although its mechanism of action is unknown. We used several proteomic approaches to identify granule proteins and find targets of the p38 MAPK and its downstream kinase, MK2, on granules. Our analysis identified 286 proteins on neutrophil granules, four of which were known MK2 substrates. Known p38 substrates were not detected. However, MRP-14 was identified as a novel p38 MAPK substrate. MRP-14 was phosphorylated by p38 MAPK in neutrophils upon cell stimulation and translocated to plasma membranes and gelatinase granules, as well as to Triton X-100-insoluble structures at the base of lamellipodia. Phosphorylation of the MRP-14 by p38 MAPK increased binding to actin in vitro. These results suggest that MRP-14 is a potential mediator of p38 MAPK-dependent exocytosis in human neutrophils"
1,Allicin Reverses Diabetes-Induced Dysfunction of Human Coronary Artery Endothelial Cells,https://core.ac.uk/works/86777009,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, and is the major source of morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes mellitus. Because the incidence of diabetes continues to increase, reducing the risk of CVD in diabetes will continue to be a major focus of cardiovascular research. An early manifestation of diabetes-induced CVD is dysfunction of the vascular endothelium, as indicated by depressed production of NO. Our findings now demonstrate depressed activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in diabetes, and suggest that treating human coronary artery endothelial cells with allicin, the major bioactive organosulfur component in garlic extract, can restore NO production in these cells. Coronary artery endothelial cells (Lonza) were obtained from control (HCAEC) or diabetic (DHCAEC) donors, and NO production was measured by fluorescence microscopy via 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate. On average, NO production was depressed by 12.9% in DHCAEC compared to controls. Treating these cells for 20 minutes with 4μM allicin restored NO production by 32.9%. Further, immunoblot studies revealed that diabetes decreased expression of eNOS protein by 20.3%; however, allicin was able to reverse this effect of diabetes. On average, eNOS expression was increased by 26% by overnight exposure to 5μM allicin. Taken together, these data indicate that allicin improves endothelium-dependent NO production in diabetes by enhancing the expression and/or activity of eNOS in human coronary artery endothelial cells. These studies further suggest that this improved endothelial function likely contributes to the established health benefits of garlic consumption (e.g., lowering blood pressure), and suggests a natural means of reducing the devastating consequences of diabetes on CVD. Future experiments are needed to identify the mechanism of allicin action on eNOS and in vascular endothelial cells"

3,Nuclear Organization and the Epigenetic Landscape of the Mus musculus X-Chromosome,https://core.ac.uk/works/84461591,"X-linked imprinted genes have been hypothesized to contribute parent-of-origin influences on social cognition. A cluster of imprinted genes Xlr3b, Xlr4b, and Xlr4c, implicated in cognitive defects, are maternally expressed and paternally silent in the murine brain. These genes defy classic mechanisms of autosomal imprinting, suggesting a novel method of imprinted gene regulation. Using Xlr3b and Xlr4c as bait, this study uses 4C-Seq on neonatal whole brain of a 39,XO mouse model, to provide the first in-depth analysis of chromatin dynamics surrounding an imprinted locus on the X-chromosome. Significant differences in long-range contacts exist between XM and XP monosomic samples. In addition, XM interaction profiles contact a greater number of genes linked to cognitive impairment, abnormality of the nervous system, and abnormality of higher mental function.
This is not a pattern that is unique to the imprinted Xlr3/4 locus. Additional 4C-Seq experiments show that other genes on the X-chromosome, implicated in intellectual disability and/or ASD, also produce more maternal contacts to other X-linked genes linked to cognitive impairment. The observation that there are differences between the maternal and paternal X interactomes is bolstered by potential variation in Atrx binding and H3K27me3 enrichment between XM and XP, suggesting that there may be broad-scale differences of the X-chromosome, related to parent-of-origin effects. Taken together, these results provide intriguing insight into the maternal X susceptibility to cognitive and social impairment"
4,"Transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in human subjects following a 36 h fast provides evidence of effects on genes regulating inflammation, apoptosis and energy metabolism.",https://core.ac.uk/works/18579909,"There is growing interest in the potential health benefits of diets that involve regular periods of fasting. While animal studies have provided compelling evidence that feeding patterns such as alternate-day fasting can increase longevity and reduce incidence of many chronic diseases, the evidence from human studies is much more limited and equivocal. Additionally, although several candidate processes have been proposed to contribute to the health benefits observed in animals, the precise molecular mechanisms responsible remain to be elucidated. The study described here examined the effects of an extended fast on gene transcript profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ten apparently healthy subjects, comparing transcript profiles after an overnight fast, sampled on four occasions at weekly intervals, with those observed on a single occasion after a further 24 h of fasting. Analysis of the overnight fasted data revealed marked inter-individual differences, some of which were associated with parameters such as gender and subject body mass. For example, a striking positive association between body mass index and the expression of genes regulated by type 1 interferon was observed. Relatively subtle changes were observed following the extended fast. Nonetheless, the pattern of changes was consistent with stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, alterations in cell cycling and apoptosis and decreased expression of key pro-inflammatory genes. Stimulation of fatty acid oxidation is an expected response, most likely in all tissues, to fasting. The other processes highlighted provide indications of potential mechanisms that could contribute to the putative beneficial effects of intermittent fasting in humans"
5,Genetic and gene expression analysis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC),https://core.ac.uk/works/8503794,"We examined both the chromosomal copy number changes and differential RNA expression profiles in Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Gene expression profiles identified a large number of differentially regulated genes involved in diverse functional processes, while genetic analysis detected extensive genomic abnormalities including large and small, discrete regions of copy number change and loci that exhibit uniparental disomy (UPD). The relationship between chromosomal copy number and level of gene expression were analysed. This revealed that the direct copy number/expression link applies in about 60% of the instances of copy number loss/down-expression and less than 35% of instances of copy number gain/up-expression that were examined. Signalling pathway analysis revealed that numerous components involved in the TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog pathways were universally upregulated in NPC tumours, and gene expression pattern of the C666-1 cell line approximated to other NPC tumours, indicating that it is a good tumour model. A preliminary in vitro investigation of signalling pathways revealed that the C666-1 cell line is intact in the activin and Hh signalling pathways but not in the TGF-β pathway. However, the C666-1 cells appear to resist activin-mediated cell growth inhibitio"
6,"Interactions between Neuronal Innate Immune Pattern Recognition Receptor Pathways and Neurotropic Arboviruses: Host Measures, Viral Countermeasures, and Potential Therapeutics.",https://core.ac.uk/works/2427023,"Neurotropic arboviruses are a group of pathogens capable of causing severe and fatal central nervous system infections for which there are few effective treatments or vaccines.  The extent of neurotropic arbovirus-mediated destruction of central nervous system neurons is often an important determinant in the severity and clinical outcome after infection.  Early cellular innate immune responses mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are often vital for effective pathogen control, and an effective neuronal innate immune response may be crucial to prevent the essentially irreversible loss of critical central nervous system neurons by neurotropic arboviruses.  The work presented here describes efforts to preserve neurotropic arbovirus-infected neurons by: a) studying the interactions between neurotropic arboviruses and neuronal PRR pathways in order to indentify novel targets for future therapeutics, and b) identifying potential anti-neurotropic arbovirus medications which target viral replication. 
    Innate PRR pathways function in both a cell and pathogen-specific manner.  However, relatively little is known about the induction and regulation of neuronal PRR signaling.  Therefore, I assessed PRR pathway expression and function in neurons and found that neurons possess functional PRR pathways mediated by select receptors and signaling molecules which activate the downstream transcription factors NFkB and IRF3 resulting in the production of genes with putative antiviral activity.  Next, I characterized how neuronal PRR pathways interact with neurotropic arboviruses using western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) as a model neurotropic arbovirus.  From these studies I concluded that IRF3 mediates a neuron-protective response to WEEV; however, this response was independent of type-I IFN signaling, which possesses potent antiviral activity and is canonically activated downstream of IRF3 in alternate cell types.  Importantly, WEEV inhibited neuronal PRR-mediated induction of antiviral type-I interferons, and this inhibitory capacity was mapped to the WEEV capsid protein.  These data indicated that neuronal PRR pathways may be important determinants in neurotropic arbovirus pathogenesis and that neuronal PRR pathways and viral countermeasures to them may be exploited to develop anti-neurotropic arboviral treatments.  Finally, I identified a novel class of small molecules which inhibit WEEV replication, protect neuronal cells from WEEV-induced cell death, and may be a useful component of future anti-neurotropic arbovirus therapies.Ph.D.Microbiology & ImmunologyUniversity of Michigan, Horace H.

1,The Transcriptomic Profiling Of Murine Embryonic Stem Cell-derived Mesodermal Cell Lineages And Functional Cardiomyocytes: An Insight Into Mesodermal Patterning,https://core.ac.uk/works/5181249,"Summary The underlying basis of vertebrate mesodermal patterning by which the mesodermal cells become sequentially determined to more precisely defined cell fates during embryonic development remains largely unknown and is one of the classical problems in developmental biology. This demands an in-depth analysis of the endogenous signaling cascades and transcription factor networks. Till date, this fascinating puzzle is not yet solved since isolation of pure early stage mesodermal cells was not feasible due to practical difficulties and hence the functional genomics of the mesodermal cells has not yet been successful. Recently, embryonic stem (ES) cells have been proven to be a promising tool to study the early embryonic development in a more physiological context in vitro because of their versatility over the other conventional systems. Furthermore, ES cells may revolutionize medicine by providing an unlimited renewable source of cells capable of replacing or repairing tissues that have been damaged in all degenerative diseases. Using ES cell model in vitro, for the first time pure populations of T Brachyury and BMP-2 expressing mesodermal lineages and mesodermal derived pure and functional cardiomyocytes have been isolated and their entire transcriptomes were profiled using microarrays. To isolate the pure lineage specific cells, stable transgenic ES clones transfected with a targeting vector construct in which the promoter of lineage specific marker (T, BMP-2 or aMHC) drives the expression of both puromycin resistance and enhanced green fluorescence bicistronically with the help of an IRES element were generated. The EBs made from these clones were treated at the onset of the particular transcript expression with puromycin to enrich the respective lineages. Furthermore, analysis of the gene signatures specific to mesodermal cells and cardiomyocytes that defines their unique cellular and genetic identities contributing a major molecular insight into mesodermal patterning has been performed. In addition, a significant number of novel putative transcripts whose functions are unknown but expressed in specific lineages are enlisted. Few of these transcripts were functionally evaluated for their role in germ layer development and patterning. In addition, the purified populations of T Brachyury and BMP-2 mesodermal cells are capable of priming themselves to give rise to cardiomyocytes along with other mesodermal lineages. Interestingly, the BMP-2 positive cells contained predominantly neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) and their lineages namely smooth muscle cells, epithelial cells, melanocytes, and astrocytes along with cardiomyocytes. The transcriptome characterization of ES cell-derived aMHC cardiomyocytes clearly proves that these cells are exhibiting the properties more like the cardiomyocytes developed in in vivo conditions from the point of biological processes and hence are promising candidates for the future cardiac cell replacement therapy. In overall, the part of the work presented here will better contribute substantially to the lineage specific transcriptomic atlas which will shed light in understanding the complex embryonic developmental process"
2,The Role of the Ku70 vWA Domain in the Response to DNA Double Strand Breaks,https://core.ac.uk/works/9183039,"Ku is an abundant, highly conserved DNA binding protein found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that plays essential roles in the maintenance of genome integrity. In eukaryotes, Ku is a heterodimer comprised of two subunits, Ku70 and Ku80, and is best characterized for its central role as the initial DNA end binding factor in the “classical” non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ) pathway, the main DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway in mammals. At the break, Ku directly and indirectly interacts with several C-NHEJ factors and processing enzymes, serving as the scaffold for the entire DNA repair complex. In this work we aim to characterize the function of the Ku70 von Willebrand A-like (vWA) domain, a protein-protein interaction domain, in Ku’s role in the response to DSBs.
In this study we identified a requirement for the Ku70 vWA domain in both NHEJ and signaling to the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway to determine cell fate decisions. We demonstrated that mutation of residues D192A/D195R in helix 5 of the Ku70 vWA domain resulted in decreased DNA repair efficiency and extremely low survival in cells treated with ionizing radiation (IR), indicating a role for these residues in NHEJ. We also identified a novel phosphorylation event at Ku70 S155 in response to DNA damage. Cells expressing a mutant Ku70 bearing an alanine substitution of this residue displayed increased survival and decreased activation of apoptosis following IR treatment, indicating a defect in the DDR pathway to relay signals to the cell death machinery. The phosphomimetic mutant of Ku70 (S155D) exhibited the opposite phenotype, very low survival after IR, and the constitutive activation of DDR markers and cell cycle arrest even in the absence of any DNA damage. We found that Ku70 S155 phosphorylation after IR was required for Ku to interact with and inhibit the Aurora Kinase B, to induce cell cycle arrest. Overall we propose that the Ku70 vWA domain functions to both facilitate the repair of breaks by NHEJ, and to relay the signal of unsuccessful repair to the DDR in order to activate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis"
3,Structure-Function Relationships Of Rna And Protein In Synaptic Plasticity,https://core.ac.uk/works/19090006,"Structure is widely acknowledged to be important for the function of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) and proteins. However, due to the relative accessibility of sequence information compared to structure information, most large genomics studies currently use only sequence-based annotation tools to analyze the function of expressed molecules. In this thesis, I introduce two novel computational methods for genome-scale structure-function analysis and demonstrate their application to identifying RNA and protein structures involved in synaptic plasticity and potentiation—important neuronal processes that are thought to form the basis of learning and memory. First, I describe a new method for de novo identification of RNA secondary structure motifs enriched in co-regulated transcripts. I show that this method can accurately identify secondary structure motifs that recur across three or more transcripts in the input set with an average recall of 0.80 and precision of 0.98. Second, I describe a tool for predicting protein structural fold from amino acid sequence, which achieves greater than 96% accuracy on benchmarks and can be used to predict protein function and identify new structural folds. Importantly, both of these tools scale linearly with increasing numbers of input sequences, making them feasible to run on thousands of sequences at a time. Finally, I use these tools to investigate RNA localization and local translation in dendrites—two processes that are prerequisites for long-lasting synaptic potentiation. Using soma- and dendrite-specific RNA-sequencing data as a starting point, I define the full set of RNAs localized to the dendrites, identify novel secondary structure motifs enriched in these RNAs that may act as dendritic localization signals, and predict the structure of all proteins that would be produced by these localized RNAs during local translation. The results shed new light on potential regulatory mechanisms of dendritic localization and roles of locally translated proteins at the synapse, and demonstrate the utility of structure-based tools in genomics analysis"
0,Depletion of the RNA Helicase SKIV2L2 Impedes Mitotic Progression and Histone mRNA Turnover in Murine Cell Lines,https://core.ac.uk/works/41645050,"RNA surveillance via the nuclear exosome requires cofactors such as the helicase SKIV2L2 to process and degrade certain noncoding RNAs. This dissertation aimed to characterize the phenotype associated with RNAi knockdown of SKIV2L2 in two murine cancer cell lines: Neuro2A and P19. Skiv2l2 knockdown in Neuro2A and P19 cells induced changes in gene expression indicative of cell differentiation and reduced cellular proliferation. Analysis of the cell cycle revealed defective progression through mitosis following SKIV2L2 depletion. These results indicate that SKIV2L2 enhances mitotic progression, thereby maintaining cancer cell proliferation and preventing differentiation. Indeed, SKIV2L2 levels were found to be downregulated during chemically induced differentiation, further implicating SKIV2L2 in maintaining proliferation and multipotency in cancer cell lines. Because SKIV2L2 targets RNAs for processing and degradation via the nuclear exosome, it was hypothesized that with SKIV2L2 depletion, the accumulation of some RNA target triggers mitotic arrest. In search of such a target, RNA-seq was utilized to identify RNAs that were elevated in Skiv2l2 knockdown cells. SKIV2L2 depletion resulted in the accumulation of non-coding RNAs, intergenic RNAs, ribosomal protein mRNAs, and replication-dependent histone mRNAs. Given that the regulation of histone mRNAs is tightly linked to the cell cycle, further experiments were conducted to confirm SKIV2L2 targets histone mRNAs for degradation. RNA immunoprecipitation demonstrated direct binding between SKIV2L2 and histone mRNAs, and RNA degradation assays showed that the half-life of histone mRNAs doubles with SKIV2L2 depletion. The resulting histone imbalance following loss of SKIV2L2-directed RNA surveillance could impede mitotic progression, resulting in mitotic defects and indirectly triggering differentiation"
1,Distinct roles of BMP and LKB1/AMPK signalling impacting ovarian cancer spheroid biology,https://core.ac.uk/works/9168872,"High-grade serous (HGS) carcinoma, the most prevalent and most deadly subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), presents unique therapeutic challenges since the majority of cases are diagnosed at advanced, metastatic stage. At this point widespread intraperitoneal metastatic lesions are numerous, which is why models that recapitulate disease dissemination are critical to uncover novel therapeutic targets. One of the initiating events in ovarian cancer metastasis is shedding from the primary tumour into the peritoneal cavity where cells must survive in suspension in order to seed secondary tumours. This non-adherent population of cells exists as multicellular aggregates, or spheroids; data from our lab has demonstrated that cells within spheroids are dormant, yet are readily alter their phenotype upon reattachment to an adherent substratum. To further explore the pathobiology of ovarian cancer spheroids, my thesis work describes the functional characterization of two different signalling pathways— bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)—which mediate distinct and important aspects of spheroid formation and reattachment. Activated BMP signalling resulted in smaller, loosely-aggregated spheroids, which were more readily able to reattach and disperse. These phenotypic alterations observed as a result of active BMP signalling were mediated, at least in part, by cooperation with the AKT signalling pathway. These studies implicate inhibition of BMP and AKT signalling as potential strategies for therapeutic targeting of reattaching spheroids, which is critical for the formation of secondary metastatic lesions. Other work in our lab implicated the downregulation of AKT signalling in spheroid formation-induced dormancy. In an attempt to uncover additional pathways promoting the dormant phenotype of ovarian cancer spheroids, I investigated the LKB1/AMPK signalling cascade given its ability to alter cellular metabolism in response to nutrient and energy availability. Despite a dramatic enhancement in AMPK activity observed in ovarian cancer spheroids, targeted knockdown had no effect on viability of cells in this context. However, knockdown of its upstream kinase, LKB1, revealed a dramatic decrease in ovarian cancer spheroid viability, suggesting a role for this kinase in mediating anoikis-resistance in an AMPK-independent manner. Taken together, my results have uncovered two distinct and important signalling pathways that regulate unique aspects of spheroid formation, cell survival, and reattachment. By understanding the molecular mechanisms used by ovarian cancer spheroids to survive during dissemination and promote secondary metastasis, my work has uncovered additional therapeutic targets for the potential treatment of advanced-stage ovarian cancer"
2,Obese Zucker Rats as a Reverse Translational Model of Human Left Ventricular Hypertrophy,https://core.ac.uk/works/107381910,"Heart failure is a lifelong disability that for over half of those affected leads to mortality within five years after initial diagnosis. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is one of the most reliable independent predictors of heart failure. Pathological LVH is irreversible, but early diagnosis is often missed due to its asymptomatic nature. Obese Zucker rats (OZR), which develop obesity due to dysfunctional leptin signaling, naturally exhibit a LVH that mimics the obese human condition. Animal models are necessary because human donor tissue is scarce. The central hypothesis is that genes and proteins that are differentially expressed during development of LVH, relative to sex and obesity status, will serve as clinical biomarkers or therapeutic targets for detection and prevention of heart failure. No previous studies have addressed LVH on an exome-wide basis. In the present research, I address these knowledge gaps with transcriptome analysis of rat and human left ventricles in a sex- and obesity-specific manner. Specific genes (NPPA, NPPB, HBB, MYL7, PDK4) known to be involved in cardiac development and function were then validated proteomically to form a LVH gene signature that may be useful for future diagnosis or represent targets for intervention. This work defines novel LVH transcriptomes in humans and OZR and these datasets allow for confirmation of whether an individual gene or geneset is translationally-relevant for further investigation in LVH. Future work should address transcriptomic and proteomic changes throughout LVH development and whether intervention targeting specific gene products can ameliorate onset of LVH"
3,"Investigating the Effect of Cell Culture Compositions on Mitochondrial Metabolism, Dynamics,                                     and Transcriptome and Proteome of cells",https://core.ac.uk/works/64622654,"The phytoestrogen Resveratrol (RES) is a natural polyphenol that has been detected in more than 70 plant species.  RES has structural similarity to mammalian estrogens and can bind to estrogen receptors, eliciting genomic and non-genomic effects. Both RES and physiological estrogens like 17-β-estradiol (E2) have wide-ranging effects on mitochondria.  In this thesis, I began by investigating RES’s effects on mitochondrial network dynamics (Chapter 2) and discovered a pro-fusion activity apparently mediated by the mitofusin enzyme Mfn2.  RES stimulated mitochondrial network hyper-fusion morphology in all three cell lines investigated (C2C12 (mouse myoblast), PC3 (prostate cancer), and MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblast)), but the effect was absent in Mfn2-null MEFs. As this work was being completed; several research groups introduced ‘physiologic cell culture media’ that are modeled on the human plasma metabolome.  I co-authored a study (not in this thesis) demonstrating that RES’s effects on mitochondrial dynamics are dependent on cell culture conditions. To follow up on this, I investigated whether E2’s mitochondrial effects might also be dependent on the cell culture environment, and showed conclusively that this is indeed the case, using C2C12 cells as a model system (Chapter 3). These results and those published by others in 2017-2019 suggested that medium composition can profoundly affect cellular functions.  In Chapter 4, I followed this up by studying how culture conditions affect mitochondrial bioenergetics and network morphology using four cancer cell lines and showed that this is a significant issue.  Finally, to gain a more complete understanding of this phenomenon, I completed a full transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of media effects using MCF7 breast cancer cells as a model (Chapter 5). I showed that hundreds of transcripts and proteins are affected according to culture conditions. Taken together, the results presented in this thesis emphasize the significant extent to which the cell culture environment affects experimental outcomes, particularly with respect to mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics. This information contributes to the development of cell culture experiments providing results that can be translated in vivo"
4,Genomic Imprinting and X Chromosome Dosage Compensation in Domestic Ruminants,https://core.ac.uk/works/68931295,"In diploid cells, genes are presumed to be expressed from both alleles to maintain gene dosage for normal development. However, a small number of genes reach haplosufficiency even with only one functional allele per cell. Most of these genes are regulated through genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation (XCI). DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic regulation for developmental programming in embryogenesis and play crucial roles in genomic imprinting and XCI. This dissertation presents 1) effects of maternal diets on genome imprinting in fetal sheep (Chapter Two), 2) dosage compensation of the X chromosomes in bovine germline, embryos and somatic tissues (Chapter Three), 3) Whole genome DNA methylation in bovine in vivo preimplantation development (Chapter Four).  In chapter two, we report the first throughput study of genomic imprinting in sheep and report the identification of 13 new imprinted genes as well as demonstrating that maternal diets affect expression of imprinted genes in fetuses. Our results determine maternal diets influence imprinted gene expression while the parental-of-origin expression pattern was not affected, further suggesting that gene expression levels and imprinted patterns may be regulated through different epigenetic mechanisms. In chapter three, we reported the up-regulation of X chromosome in bovine germline, embryos and somatic tissues, supporting a balanced expression between a single active X and autosome pairs. However, deviating from Ohno’s theory, dosage compensation to rescue X haploinsufficiency appears to be an incomplete process for expressed genes but a complete process for “dosage-sensitive” genes. In chapter four, we adopted the scWGBS-seq method to comprehensive profile 5-MeC in single-cytosine resolution in bovine sperm, immature oocyte, in vivo/vitro mature single oocyte, and in vivo developed 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-cell single embryos. We observed global demethylation during bovine embryo cleavage up to 8-cell stage and de novo methylation at 16-cell stage. Our results refined the current knowledge on bovine embryo DNA methylation dynamics and provide valuable resources for future studies"
5,Molecular characterization of Th17 lymphocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells in the context of HIV-1 infection,https://core.ac.uk/works/17855112,"Le virus de l’immunodéficience humaine de type 1 (VIH-1) altère les fonctions du système immunitaire pour promouvoir sa persistance. Les composantes de l’immunité ciblées par le VIH-1 incluent les lymphocytes Th17 et les cellules dendritiques dérivées des monocytes (CDDMs). Deux sous-populations de lymphocytes Th17, nommées Th17 et Th1Th17, ont précédemment été décrites avec des propriétés transcriptionnelles et des spécificités antigéniques distinctes. Les cellules Th17 et Th1Th17 sont hautement permissives à l’infection par le VIH et leur fréquence est diminuée chez les sujets chroniquement infectés sous trithérapie antirétrovirale. Toutefois, seulement une fraction des lymphocytes Th17 est infectée par le VIH, indiquant l’existence de Th17 résistants à la réplication virale. Également, il est connu que l’infection à VIH induit une altération de la fréquence des monocytes reflétée par l’expansion de la population monocytaire exprimant le récepteur Fcγ de type III/CD16. Les monocytes sont des précurseurs de cellules dendritiques et une altération de ratio entre les monocytes CD16+ et CD16- pourrait avoir des conséquences délétères sur la qualité des réponses immunitaires. Le rôle fonctionnel des CDDM exprimant ou non CD16 dans le contexte de la pathogénèse à VIH-1 demeure inconnu. Ce projet de thèse est divisé en 2 parties: 1) l’étude de l’hétérogénéité des cellules Th17 et 2) la caractérisation approfondie des CDDM CD16+ et CD16- dans le contexte d’homéostasie et de la pathogénèse de l’infection à VIH. Dans la première partie, nous avons fonctionnellement caractérisé deux nouvelles sous-populations de lymphocytes Th17 avec une expression différentielle des récepteurs de chimiokines CXCR3 et CCR4 : nommés CCR6+DN et CCR6+DP, exprimant toutes les deux CCR6, marqueur de lymphocytes Th17. Nous avons démontré que les cellules CCR6+DN et CCR6+DP partagent des caractéristiques biologiques communes avec les cellules Th17 et Th1Th17 incluant la permissivité au VIH. Nos résultats indiquent que les cellules CCR6+DN représentent un stade précoce de différentiation des lymphocytes Th17 et expriment des marqueurs de cellules T folliculaires. De plus, comparativement aux sous-populations Th17, Th1Th17 et CCR6+DP, la fréquence et le compte des CCR6+DN sont préservés au sein des sujets chroniquement infectés sous thérapie antirétrovirale. Nous proposons un modèle dans lequel les cellules CCR6+DN représentent des lymphocytes Th17 résistantes à l’effet cytopatique du virus qui contribuent à la persistance virale par leur capacité de porter un virus compétent en matière de réplication. Dans la deuxième partie, nos résultats révèlent que les CDDMs CD16+ et CD16- représentent deux populations uniques avec des propriétés transcriptionelles et fonctionnelles distinctes. Les CDDMs CD16- détiennent un potentiel immunogène supérieur tandis que les CDDMs CD16+ ont une meilleure capacité de transmettre le virus aux cellules T CD4+ au repos. Également, nous confirmons l’effet néfaste du VIH sur les fonctions immunologiques des cellules DC à stimuler la prolifération et la polarisation des cellules Th17 spécifiques à C. albicans et à S. aureus. En conclusion, les résultats inclus dans cette thèse fournissent une compréhension détaillée sur l’hétérogénéité présente au sein des lymphocytes Th17 et des CDDMs et révèlent de nouveaux déterminants moléculaires de l’immunité exploités par le VIH au profit de sa persistance.The ultimate aim of immunity is to restrict the emergence of exogenous pathogens while providing immune tolerance to self-antigens. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disrupts the functions of the immune system to promote its own dissemination and persistence. The components of the host immunity targeted by HIV-1 include the Th17 lineage and the monocytes. The Th17 lineage was previously reported to include two different populations referred to as the Th17 and Th1Th17 cells exhibiting different transcriptional profiles and antigenic specificities. Both Th17 and Th1Th17 cells are permissive to HIV and their frequency is reduced in the blood and gut mucosa of chronically HIV-infected subjects. Nevertheless, HIV-1 infects only a fraction of the Th17 pool, suggesting the existence of Th17 cells resistant to HIV. In addition, it well documented that HIV-1 infection alters the pool of peripheral blood monocytes and induces the expansion of a monocytic population expressing the Fcγ receptor III/CD16. Monocytes are precursors for dendritic cells (DCs) and an altered CD16+/CD16- monocyte ratio may have deleterious consequences on the quality of immune responses. The functional features of CD16+ versus CD16- monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) in the context of HIV infection remain to be elucidated. This thesis is divided in two parts: 1) the study of Th17 cell heterogeneity and 2) the in depth characterization of CD16+ and CD16- monocytes-derived DCs (MDDCs) at homeostasis and during HIV-1 infection. In the first part, we have identified and functionally characterized two new previously uncharacterized subsets of CCR6+ T-cells with differential expression of CXCR3 and CCR4, double negative CCR4-CXCR3- (CCR6+DN) and double positive CCR4+CXCR3+ (CCR6+DP) subsets.  We demonstrated CCR6+DN and CCR6+DP share cytokine production, antigenic specificity, lineage plasticity and HIV permissiveness with the previously characterized Th17 (CCR6+CCR4+CXCR3-) and Th1Th17 (CCR6+CCR4-CXCR3+) subsets. Among these four Th17 subsets, CCR6+DN cells were found to represent an early stage of Th17 differentiation and expressed features of T follicular helper T-cells. Moreover, in contrast to Th17, Th1Th17 and CCR6+DP subsets, the frequency and counts of CCR6+DN cells was preserved in chronically HIV-infected subjects under antiretroviral treatments compared to uninfected controls. Our results suggest that CCR6+DN represent long-lived Th17 cells contributing to HIV persistence by carrying replication-competent virus. In the second part, our results reveal that CD16+ and CD16- MDDCs represent two distinct populations with unique transcriptional programs and immunological functions. CD16- MDDCs displayed a superior immunogenic potential, whereas CD16+ MDDCs exhibited a higher capacity to induce HIV replication in resting CD4+ T-cells. Also, we confirmed the negative effect of HIV on DCs immunogenic function involving the stimulation of T-cell proliferation and Th17 polarization in response to pathogens such as C. albicans and S. aureus. Overall, in this thesis we provide a better understanding on Th17 and MDDC heterogeneity and reveal new molecular determinants of pathogenicity in immune cells that are exploited by HIV-1 to insure its persistence in the infected host"
6,LATE EVENTS OF HUMAN METAPNEUMOVIRUS INFECTION: INSIGHTS INTO VIRAL SPREAD WITHIN THE RESPIRATORY EPITHELIUM,https://core.ac.uk/works/69235336,"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of respiratory tract infections worldwide across all age groups, and is particularly devastating in the pediatric, elderly and immunocompromised populations. Despite its high prevalence and burden on human health, there are currently no treatments or vaccines against HMPV infections. HMPV is an enveloped virus that belongs to the paramyxovirus family. Paramyxoviruses in general form by assembly of virus components at the plasma membrane followed by budding and release of virus particles into the extracellular matrix to spread infection. The process of forming new virus particles requires complex interactions between viral and cellular components and the requirements for particle production differ substantially among paramyxoviruses. Several key aspects of the life cycle of HMPV remain unknown. The work presented here provides significant advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying assembly and spread of HMPV in human bronchial airway epithelial cells. We provide evidence that HMPV induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules at late stages of infection leading to the formation of complex networks of branched filaments and intercellular extensions, structures that have not been previously reported for paramyxoviruses. Our results indicate a novel mode of HMPV spread directly from cell-to-cell across intercellular extensions. We identified an important role of actin and the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 in direct cell-to-cell spread of HMPV. While roles for paramyxovirus matrix and fusion proteins in membrane deformation have been previously demonstrated for several paramyxoviruses, we show that the HMPV phosphoprotein (P) associates with actin and induces formation of membrane extensions, suggesting a role for the P protein in HMPV exit from the cell. Additionally, infection of differentiated, polarized human airway tissues showed that release of HMPV particles at the apical side is inefficient and revealed that spread of HMPV in these tissues can occur in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. HMPV infection also resulted in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in these tissues mainly at the apical side. Collectively, the data provided in this dissertation reveal a novel mechanism by which HMPV uses the cytoskeleton for cell-to-cell transmission and provide critical insights into spread of respiratory viruses within the airway epithelium"
7,Generation and Characterisation of Novel Monoclonal Antibodies towards Ovarian Tumour Stem Cells,https://core.ac.uk/works/33241128,"Tumour stem cells (TSCs) are hypothesised to be a rare population of tumour cells which possess stem cell-like properties and are resistant to conventional therapy. Although cell surface markers have been widely used to characterise TSCs, previous literature suggests that no specific marker has been found for ovarian TSCs. We aimed to identify and characterise novel antibodies specific to ovarian epithelial TSCs, particularly towards populations with Hoechst efflux (Side Population, SP) and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity which are associated with a stem cell phenotype and drug resistance.
Putative TSC subpopulations from ovarian tumour cell lines isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using differential Hoechst dye uptake and Aldefluor activity assays displayed stem cell-like characteristics, including the upregulation of stem cell markers, increased anchorage-independent growth and increased invasive properties. A panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was then generated by injecting Aldefluor-positive ovarian tumour IGROV1 cells into female BALB/c mice. 34 antibodies were found to be specific to Aldefluor-positive cells and 2 of these enriched for SP cells. The 2 mAbs demonstrated cross-reactivity on human embryonic stem cells but no cross-reactivity to normal ovarian cell lines. Subpopulations of ovarian cell lines positive for the mAbs displayed stem cell-like characteristics, including upregulation of stem cell markers - CD133, ABCB1 and ALDH1A1. Sorted mAb populations were injected into non-obese diabetic/severe combined (NOD/SCID) mice and differential in vivo tumour formation was observed. Finally, the target antigen which both mAbs recognised was identified by mass spectrometry to be clathrin heavy chain (CHC1).
We conclude that rare subpopulations with tumour-sustaining capability and stem cell-like characteristics can be identified in ovarian cancer using the 2 novel antibodies generated. Both mAbs target CHC1 on tumour-sustaining populations which are enriched for multiple stem cell markers and are therefore potential novel diagnostic markers and/or therapeutic agents"
0,Analysis of Helicobacter pylori VacA-containing vacuoles and VacA intracellular trafficking,https://core.ac.uk/works/62680127,"The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori colonizes half of the global population. Residing at the stomach epithelium, it contributes to the development of diseases like gastritis, duodenal and gastric ulcers, and gastric cancer. It has evolved a range of mechanisms to aid in colonization and persistence, manipulating the host immune response to avoid clearance. A major factor in this is the secreted vacuolating cytotoxin VacA which has a variety of effects on host cells. VacA is endocytosed and forms anion-selective channels in the endosome membrane, causing the compartment to swell. The resulting VacA-containing vacuoles (VCVs) can take up most of the cellular cytoplasm. Even though vacuolation is VacA's most prominent and namesake effect, the purpose of the vacuoles is still unknown.

VacA exerts influence on the host immune response in various ways, both pro- and anti- inflammatorily. Most importantly, it disrupts calcium signaling in T-lymphocytes, inhibiting T-cell activation and proliferation and thereby suppressing the host immune response. Furthermore, VacA is transported to mitochondria, where it activates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Within the cell, VacA has only been shown to localize to endocytic compartments/VCVs and mitochondria. Considering its diverse effects, however, the existence of other cellular sites of action seems plausible.

In this study, the VCV proteome was comprehensively analyzed for the first time in order to investigate VCV function. To this end, three different strategies for VCV purification from T-cells were devised and tested. Eventually, VCVs were successfully isolated via immunomagnetic separation, using a VacA-specific primary antibody and a secondary antibody coupled to magnetic beads. The purified vacuoles were then measured by mass spectrometry, revealing not only proteins of the endocytic system, but also proteins usually localized in other cellular compartments. This apparent recruitment of proteins involved in all kinds of cellular pathways indicates a central function of VCVs in VacA intoxication effects.

In a global evaluation, the VCV proteome exhibited an enrichment of proteins implicated in immune response, cell death, and cellular signaling; all of these are processes that VacA is known to influence. One of the individual proteins contained in the sample was STIM1, a calcium sensor normally residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is important in store- operated calcium entry (SOCE). This corroborates the findings of a concurrent report, in which VacA severely influenced SOCE and colocalized with STIM1. A direct interaction of STIM1 with VacA was examined in a pull-down assay, but could be neither shown nor excluded.

Immunofluorescence experiments conducted in HeLa cells confirmed the presence of VacA in the ER and also found it to traffic to the Golgi apparatus, identifying these two cellular compartments as novel VacA target structures. The exact route of VacA transport remains unclear, but the involvement of both the ER and the Golgi suggests the possibility of retrograde trafficking, analogous to other bacterial toxins like shiga and cholera toxins.

In summary, the elucidation of the VCV proteome and the discovery of the ER and the Golgi apparatus as VacA target structures have generated intriguing starting points for future studies. The detection of many proteins implicated in VacA intoxication effects in the VCV proteome leads to the proposal of VCVs as signaling hubs that may coordinate the complex meshwork of VacA effects. Further investigation of individual proteins is expected to help greatly in illuminating this matter"
1,Investigating the Nuclear Function of the C9orf72 Protein in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,https://core.ac.uk/works/8608392,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a terminal neurodegenerative disorder where

death of the upper and lower motor neurons causes progressive muscle wasting

and paralysis. Currently, the approved treatments for ALS provide only a small

therapeutic benefit to patients. A GGGGCC repeat expansion mutation that lies

within the C9orf72 gene is causal of approximately 40% of the inherited form of

ALS. The mutation has been demonstrated to cause haploinsufficiency of the

C9orf72 protein and this loss of function is hypothesised to contribute to

pathogenesis in C9orf72-ALS. Until recently, little was known about the protein

function of C9orf72. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to investigate the

C9orf72 interactome which identified binding between C9orf72 and coilin. Coilin is

the major protein component of nuclear suborganelles, Cajal bodies, which are

responsible for processing snRNPs that form the spliceosome. C9orf72-ALS

patients exhibit splicing defects which correlate with disease severity. We therefore

hypothesised that loss of the C9orf72-coilin interaction leads to dysregulation of

Cajal bodies and splicing in C9orf72-ALS.

The aims of this project were to characterise the C9orf72-coilin interaction and

investigate the effect of C9orf72 on Cajal bodies and splicing. C9orf72 was found to

interact with coilin directly in vitro and within cells, suggesting the interaction has

biological importance. Depletion of C9orf72 in HEK293 cells led to an increase in

the number of Cajal bodies, and a subtle defect in splicing. In contrast, C9orf72

overexpression decreased the number of Cajal bodies, but had little effect on

splicing. Interestingly, investigation of Cajal bodies in C9orf72-ALS patient

iAstrocytes found patients exhibited higher numbers of Cajal bodies in comparison

to healthy controls.

The work included in this thesis uncovered an interaction between C9orf72 and

coilin and that depletion of C9orf72 can lead to abnormal numbers of Cajal bodies.

The results support evidence for a novel, uncharacterised role for C9orf72 in the

nucleus which may be linked with snRNP processing, Cajal bodies and splicing.

Investigation into the function of nuclear C9orf72 will lead to greater understanding

of the consequences of C9orf72 haploinsufficiency in ALS and may lead to

development of better drug treatments for patients"
2,The Investigation of Targets for Therapy in Brain Tumours,https://core.ac.uk/works/4764206,"Gliomas are among the most difficult of tumours to treat. Their highly invasive

nature leads to recurrence even after aggressive therapy including surgery,

radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A promising target for new therapies are tyrosine

kinases, because they regulate a large range of proteins involved in growth,

metabolism and differentiation. The receptor tyrosine kinases, epidermal growth

factor receptor (EGFR), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and C-Kit,

as well as the non-receptor tyrosine kinase C-Abl are often amplified,

overexpressed, and/or mutated in gliomas and play an important role in glioma

development. A number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed

and tested in clinical trials with mixed results.

In collaboration with Beaumont hospital 31 glioma cell cultures were

established to identify molecular markers indicative of responsiveness to EGFR and

PDGFR blockade. Each culture was characterised with regard to their protein

expression profile, their proliferative and invasive behaviour and their

responsiveness to three TKIs, erlotinib, gefitinib and imatinib, and two

chemotherapy drugs, docetaxel and temozolomide.

All data of 26 high-grade gliomas (20 primary glioblastomas, 2 secondary

glioblastomas, and 4 grade III astrocytomas including medical history of the patients

were analysed using hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal component

analysis (PCA) employing multivariate statistics.

Two distinct clusters of samples were found, which separated by the

expression of PTEN and PDGFR-a in cluster 1 and predominately PDGFR-b,

EGFR, phosphorylated C-Kit (p-C-Kit) and phosphorylated C-Abl (p-C-Abl)

expression in cluster 2. Principal components analysis of the culture data captured

55% of the variance in the dataset showing PTEN, PGDFR-a and PGDFR-� loading

vectors in approximately the same direction.

Imatinib responsiveness was strongly correlated with high expression levels

of PTEN and PDGFR-a. Responsiveness to erlotinib was correlated with the lack of

expression of all proteins tested, while non-responders showed higher expression of

PTEN and PDGFR-a. Responders to gefitinib fit into two groups, the majority

(group 1) were influenced by the expression of the proteins tested, while the second

smaller group correlated with the lack of protein expression. Non-responders t"
3,Autism Spectrum Disorders,https://core.ac.uk/works/126151060,"Estimated prevalence rates of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have increased at an alarming rate over the past decade; current estimates stand as high as 1 in 110 persons in the population with a higher ratio of affected males to females. In addition to their emotional impact on the affected persons and their family members (in fact, the latter are often unrecognized unaffected â€œpatientsâ€  themselves), the economic and social impacts of ASDs on society are staggering. Persons with ASDs will need interdisciplinary approaches to complex treatment and life planning, including, but not limited to, special education, speech and language therapy, vocational skills training and rehabilitation, social skills training and cognitive remediation, in addition to pharmacotherapy. The current book highlights some of the recent research on nosology, etiology, and pathophysiology. Additionally, the book touches on the implications of new research for treatment and genetic counseling. Importantly, because the field is advancing rapidly, no book can be considered the final word or finished product; thus, the availability of open access rapid publication is a mechanism that will help to assure that readers remain current and up-to-date"
4,Mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs) and their role in mammalian gene function and evolution,https://core.ac.uk/works/7793379,"Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous components of plant and animal genomes and constitute more than ~45% of the human genome. Though originally considered as 'parasitic' or 'junk' DNA, TEs are now thought to have played a role in shaping genomes during evolution, contributing to genome plasticity and diversity. All classes of retrotransposons accumulate in the genome via a process termed retrotransposition, wherein the elements are reverse transcribed into RNA and inserted into the genome as DNA. Exaptation of these elements can provide additional or novel function for endogenous genes. Mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs) are short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), belonging to the non-autonomous class of retroelements and are found in all mammals. The recruitment of an MIR element by a gene may provide insight into mammalian evolution and gene function"
5,Characterization of novel epigenetic targets in ovarian cancer,https://core.ac.uk/works/115485723,"Le cancer épithélial de l’ovaire (CEO) représente 4% de tous les cancers chez la femme et est la première cause de décès parmi les tumeurs gynécologiques. Dans la plupart part des cas le CEO est diagnostiqué dans les stades avancés de la maladie. Le traitement repose sur la chirurgie cytoréductive suivie de la chimiothérapie combinant les dérivés de platine et de taxanes avec un taux de réponse de plus de 80%, cependant, la plupart part des patientes font une récidive par l’émergence de la résistance. Les bases moléculaires du déclenchement et de la progression du cancer de l’ovaire sont encore mal connues empêchant ainsi le développement de nouvelles approches thérapeutiques et de diagnostique. Au cours d’un cancer, l’hyperméthylation des ilots CpG de certains promoteurs géniques conduit souvent à l’inactivation des gènes suppresseurs de tumeur. L’hypométhylation des ilots CpG de certains promoteurs est également impliquée dans la réactivation des proto-oncogènes et des gènes pro-métastatiques. Cependant l’hypométhlation de l’ADN dans le cancer de l’ovaire est très peu étudiée. En utilisant la méthode d’immunoprécipitation de l'ADN méthylée combinée à une analyse sur puce (MeDIP-chip), nous avons trouvé que l’hyperméthylation de l'ADN se produit dans les stades précoces du cancer ovarien, tandis que les stades avancés de la maladie sont liés à l’hypométhylation de l’ADN des oncogènes impliqués dans la progression de la tumeur, l’invasion/métastase et probablement dans la chimiorésistance. Cette approche épigénomique a conduit à l’identification de nouveaux oncogènes hypométhylés dans le CEO. Dans cette étude, RUNX2 est identifié comme un gène hypométhylé dans les cellules post-chimiothérapeutiques et GALNT3 et BCAT1 sont parmi les gènes hypométhylés identifiés particulièrement dans le CEO de type séreux. L’analyse fonctionnelle de ces trois gènes montre qu’ils sont associés à la prolifération (y compris le contrôle du cycle cellulaire pour GALNT3 et BCAT1), de la migration et de l'invasion cellulaire dans le CEO séreux, suggérant qu’ils ont un fort potentiel oncogène dans la progression de la tumeur et pourraient être des nouvelles cibles thérapeutiques au niveau du CEO.Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) accounts for 4% of all cancers in women and is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies. Most of EOC cases are diagnosed at advanced stage, which is associated with poor outcome. Despite the good initial response to chemotherapy, recurrence occurs in the majority of patients, resulting in chemotherapy resistance leading to a fatal disease. The molecular basis of EOC initiation and progression is still poorly understood, thus hindering the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for more effective EOC treatment. In cancer, the hypermethylation of gene promoter CpG islands leads to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, and CpG islands hypomethylation is associated with proto-oncogenes and pro-metastasis genes. Similar to all malignancies, aberrant DNA methylation occurs in EOC. However, DNA hypomethylation in ovarian cancer is very briefly studied. Using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) coupled to CpG island tiling arrays, we found that DNA hypermethylation occurred in less invasive/early stages of ovarian tumorigenesis, while advanced disease was associated with DNA hypomethylation of a number of oncogenes, implicated in cancer progression, invasion/metastasis and probably chemoresistance. This epigenomic approach has led to the identification of a number of novel oncogenes hypomethylated in EOC. In this thesis study, RUNX2 gene was identified as hypomethyleted gene in post-chemotherapy primary cells cultures and GALNT3 gene and BCAT1 gene were among the genes identified to be notably hypomethylated in serous EOC tumors. Subsequent functional analyses of these three genes demonstrated that they were associated with EOC cell proliferation (including cell cycle control for GALNT3 and BCAT1), migration and invasion, suggesting that they have strong oncogenic potential in serous EOC progression and that they might be novel EOC therapeutic targets"
6,Analysis of cellular responses to microwave irradiation in E. coli and change of oxygen level and culture medium in human cancer cell lines using RNA-seq based transcriptomic profiling,https://core.ac.uk/works/64621156,"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is one of the applications of next-generation sequencing (NGS) with differential gene expression (DGE) analysis at the transcriptomic level as its primary objective. Among the NGS technologies, the Illumina platforms are the current standard for RNA-seq analysis for their best cost efficiency and sequencing accuracy. In this study, we employed Illumina-based RNA-seq to examine the gene expression profile change in E. coli cells after exposure to microwave irradiation (MWI) and in cancer cell lines in response to different culture conditions using breast cancer cell lines (MCF7) and prostate cancer cell lines (PC3) as the models. 
Our results in examining the gene expression change in E. coli showed that the non-thermal effects of MWI led to E. coli cells entering the stationary phase with most of the downregulated genes involved in metabolic and biosynthesis pathways. MWI also upregulated the expression of genes important for the maintenance of membrane integrity and adhesion associated with bacterial motility. In comparison with other similar studies, our methodology allowed us to observe the impact of non-thermal effects of MWI at 2.45 GHz via simultaneous cooling. 
Our results in examining the transcriptomic profile of MCF7 and PC3 cells in response to oxygen level and culture medium change showed that gene expression in MCF7 is highly affected by oxygen level and culture medium changes when compared to PC3, especially in DMEM at 18% O2. DNA replication, cell-cycle, and viral carcinogenesis are the most affected pathways observed from different culture conditions in both cell lines. In PC3, only the legionellosis seems to be most impacted by culture medium changes at 5% O2, involving 8 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), important for cancer cell development. DGE analysis also provides the transcriptomic profile of MCF7 and PC3, showing that different nutrient composition (between DMEM and Plasmax) and oxygen levels (5% O2 and 18% O2) changes the metabolism and various signaling pathways in both cell lines differently suggesting that the oxygen level and culture medium are important factors impacting the outcome of cell culture-based experiments in cell type-specific fashion"
